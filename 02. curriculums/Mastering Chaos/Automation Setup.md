## Make Email Work for You 24/7

It's time to make a shift from:

> "I need to personally send every email to show I care"

To:

> "Professional automation lets me focus on high-value client work while maintaining excellent communication"

Automation doesn't make you seem less personal—it makes you more organized and reliable.

## Step 3: Follow-Up Automation

### Proposal Follow-Up Sequences

You send a proposal and then... wait. Or manually remember to follow up in a few days. But we can automate this with CRM tools like Honeybook, Dubsado, or apps mentioned below.

**The Automated Proposal Follow-Up Sequence:**

```
DAY 0: Proposal sent
"Hi [Name], attached is your custom proposal for [project]. Questions? Just reply here!"

DAY 3: First follow-up (if no response)
"Hi [Name], wanted to check if you had any questions about the [project] proposal I sent Tuesday. Happy to hop on a quick call to discuss any details. What questions can I answer?"

DAY 7: Second follow-up (if no response)
"Hi [Name], following up once more on the [project] proposal. I know decisions take time! If you need more time to review, just let me know. If you'd like to move forward, simply reply 'approved' and I'll send the contract."

DAY 14: Final follow-up (if no response)
"Hi [Name], I'll assume the [project] isn't a priority right now, which is completely understandable. Feel free to reach out when you're ready to move forward—this proposal will remain valid for the next 30 days."
```

### Tools for Follow-Up Automation

**Boomerang** (Gmail/Outlook)
- "Respond If No Reply" feature
- Set up automatic follow-ups if client doesn't respond
- Customizable timing and message content

**Mixmax** (Gmail)
- Email sequences for automated follow-ups
- Conditional logic based on recipient actions
- Integration with CRM systems

**Manual Follow-Up System:** If automation tools aren't in budget:

1. Create calendar reminders for follow-up dates
2. Use task management system to track proposal status
3. Create follow-up email templates for consistency
4. Set weekly review to check proposal statuses

### Client Onboarding Automation

**Automated Welcome Sequence:**

**EMAIL 1:** Contract signed (immediate)
```
Subject: Welcome to [Project Name]! Here's what happens next

Hi [Name], excited to start working on [project]! Here's what happens next: 

[onboarding steps]

Your project dashboard is ready at [link].
```

**EMAIL 2:** Day 2 after contract
```
Subject: [Project Name] - Quick project questionnaire

Hi [Name], to ensure we start strong, please complete this brief project questionnaire: [link]

This helps me customize the approach for your specific goals.
```

**EMAIL 3:** Day before project starts
```
Subject: [Project Name] starts tomorrow - ready to go!

Hi [Name], we officially kick off [project] tomorrow! I'll send the first update on [day].

Questions before we begin? Just reply here.
```

**EMAIL 4:** First week of project
```
Subject: [Project Name] - Week 1 update

Hi [Name], great first week on [project]! Here's the progress: 

[details]

Next week we'll focus on [upcoming work].
```

### Payment Follow-Up Automation

**Invoice Follow-Up Sequence:**

**DAY 0:** Invoice sent
```
"Invoice #[number] for [project/month] attached. Payment due [date]. Thanks!"
```

**DAY 3:** Friendly reminder (if unpaid)
```
"Quick reminder that Invoice #[number] is due [date]. Payment link: [link]. Questions? Just reply!"
```

**DAY 7:** Past due follow-up
```
"Invoice #[number] is now past due. Please submit payment at your earliest convenience: [link]. If there are any issues, let me know."
```

**DAY 14:** Serious follow-up
```
"Invoice #[number] is now 14 days past due. To avoid late fees and maintain our working relationship, please submit payment immediately: [link]. If payment isn't received by [date], work will be paused until account is current."
```

## Step 4: Calendar Integration & Meeting Automation

### Automated Meeting Coordination

   - Required information from bookers
6. Set up notifications:

   - Reminder emails
   - Calendar invites with video call links

**Google Calendar Appointment Slots:**

1. Open Google Calendar
