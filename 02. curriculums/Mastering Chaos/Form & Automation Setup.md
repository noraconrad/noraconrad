## Building Your Automation System

### Step 1: Choose Your Tools

**Minimum Setup:**
- Email client with templates + scheduling
- Forms tool (Google Forms or Typeform)
- CRM or spreadsheet to track responses

**Optimal Setup:**
- Email automation (Boomerang/Mixmax)
- Forms with auto-population (Typeform/JotForm)
- CRM or project management tool
- Zapier or Make for connecting tools

### Step 2: Map Your Workflows

For each major process, document:
1. Trigger (what starts the automation)
2. Sequence (what happens when)
3. Manual handoffs (where human interaction is needed)
4. Success metrics (how to know it's working)

### Step 3: Build Gradually

Start with 1-2 automations:
- New client onboarding sequence
- Proposal follow-up

Test thoroughly. Add more when first ones are working.

### Step 4: Monitor and Refine

Track:
- How many people complete each automated step
- Where people drop off
- What needs manual adjustment
- What could be further automated
