## Advanced Documentation Strategies

### Creating "Virtual Assistant Ready" Documentation

If you ever want to delegate, your documentation needs multiple levels:

#### Level 1: Basic Task Documentation

```
TASK: Send Invoice to Client

STEP-BY-STEP:
1. Go to your invoice template in [LOCATION]
2. Create copy with naming format: [CLIENT]-Invoice-[DATE]
3. Fill in these fields:
   - Client name (from contract)
   - Project name (from contract)
   - Invoice amount (from contract)
   - Due date (30 days from today)
   - Payment methods: [list your options]
4. Save to [LOCATION]
5. Email using [EMAIL TEMPLATE] from your templates
6. Add to CRM with "invoiced" tag
7. Set calendar reminder for payment follow-up on due date

TIME REQUIRED: 10 minutes
QUALITY CHECK: 
✓ All client info correct
✓ Amount matches contract
✓ Due date is accurate
✓ Sent from correct email
```

#### Level 2: Decision-Making Frameworks

```
PROCESS: Handling Scope Change Request

When a client requests a change mid-project:

IF the change takes < 1 hour of work:
→ Include as revision or small adjustment
→ No additional cost
→ No timeline change needed

IF the change takes 1-5 hours of work:
→ Send scope change proposal
→ Calculate additional cost at [RATE]/hour
→ Discuss timeline impact
→ Wait for approval before proceeding

IF the change takes > 5 hours of work:
→ Treat as separate project
→ Create new proposal and contract
→ Schedule meeting to discuss timeline and budget

NEVER:
✗ Agree to scope change without discussing impact
✗ Add work without documenting it
✗ Absorb large scope changes

ALWAYS:
✓ Get scope change in writing
✓ Update timeline/budget
✓ Get client approval before starting work
```

#### Level 3: Problem-Solving Resources

```
TROUBLESHOOTING: Client Isn't Responding to Feedback Request

FIRST:
✓ Check if email went to spam (search client name)
✓ Verify correct email address
✓ Confirm deadline hasn't passed yet

IF EMAIL IS LOST:
→ Resend with new subject line
→ Call or message via alternate channel

IF DEADLINE APPROACHING:
→ Send urgent follow-up
→ Offer to schedule call to discuss feedback
→ Escalate: [CONTACT INFO]

IF PATTERN (client always slow):
→ In future, build extra buffer time
→ Confirm response deadline in kick-off call
→ Provide calendar reminders to client

WHEN TO ESCALATE:
Contact [YOUR_NAME] when:
• Client hasn't responded in 1 week
• Project timeline is threatened
• Client seems unhappy or disengaged
• You're unsure how to proceed
```
