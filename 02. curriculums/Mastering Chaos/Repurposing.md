### The Content Multiplication Formula

The most efficient content creators don't create more. They repurpose better.

One piece of high-quality content should generate 15-25 shorter pieces.

## AI Content Assistance

Use AI tools to speed up repurposing (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):

**Prompt for Blog to Social:**
```
"Take this blog post about [TOPIC] and create 8 LinkedIn posts that highlight different key insights. Each post should: be 150-200 characters, include a hook, 2-3 bullet points, and end with an engaging question. Format each as a separate post."
```

**Prompt for Video to Blog:**
```
"Convert this YouTube video transcript about [TOPIC] into a 1,500-word blog post optimized for SEO. Include: compelling headline with keyword, introduction with hook, 4 main sections with subheadings, conclusion with CTA. Target keyword: [KEYWORD]. Include related keywords naturally throughout."
```

**Prompt for Long-Form to Short-Form:**
```
"From this [ARTICLE/TRANSCRIPT], create 5 different 30-second video scripts for TikTok/Instagram Reels. Each should focus on one key insight and follow this structure: attention-grabbing hook (3 sec), main point explained simply (15 sec), proof or example (8 sec), CTA (4 sec)."
```
