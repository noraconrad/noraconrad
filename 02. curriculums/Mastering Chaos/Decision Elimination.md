## Building Your Business Operations Manual

### The Trap of "Only I Can Do This"

Most entrepreneurs are trapped in a cycle where their business knowledge lives entirely in their head. This is okay at the beginning stages of business, but as your business grows, you can only hold and process so much information.

**Does this sound like you?**

- You recreate emails from scratch because you forgot how you worded it last time
- You spend 20 minutes figuring out your own invoicing process each month
- You can't take a day off because no one else knows how to handle client questions
- You waste time remembering your own procedures instead of executing them

### Here's the Bigger Issue

- 30-40% of your time is spent "figuring out" things you've already figured out before
- You can't delegate because nothing is documented
- Growth is limited by your personal capacity
- You're one sick day away from chaos

## The "Hire an Assistant Tomorrow" Framework

### Documenting Everything with Fresh Eyes

Every process you document should pass this test:

> "Could someone with basic business skills follow these instructions and get the same result I would?"

### What This Means

- Write instructions assuming zero context about your business
- Include every step, even the "obvious" ones
- Specify exact tools, templates, and decision criteria
- Create templates for every repeated task
- Build FAQ databases for common scenarios

### Why This Matters

Even if you never hire anyone, this documentation will:

✅ Save you hours of "remembering how to do things"  
✅ Ensure consistent quality in your business processes  
✅ Make it possible to take real time off  
✅ Create the foundation for business growth and scaling

## Week 03 Overview: The 6-Phase Approach

This week, we'll build your complete operations manual through six focused phases:

### Phase 1: Process Documentation & Template Creation
Map your core business processes and create reusable templates for each one. This is your foundation—every repeated task gets documented and templated.

### Phase 2: Email Template Database
Build a comprehensive email template library beyond Week 02. These are situation-specific templates for complex scenarios: project management emails, difficult conversations, scope changes, price negotiations.

### Phase 3: Contract & Legal Document Templates
Create your standard contracts, proposals, and legal documents so you're not recreating them from scratch each time. Includes decision trees for customization.

### Phase 4: Customer Service & Response System
Document your customer service processes: how you handle objections, complaints, refunds, cancellations. Create scripts and response templates for every scenario.

### Phase 5: Form & Automation Setup
Set up intake forms, project questionnaires, and automation rules that pre-populate information, reducing manual data entry and decision-making.

### Phase 6: Implementation & Testing
Roll out your complete operations manual, test it with real scenarios, refine based on what actually works, and create a maintenance schedule.

## The Power of This Week

By the end of Week 03, you'll have:

- ✅ Every core business process documented
- ✅ Templates for 95% of your recurring communications
- ✅ Decision frameworks for complex scenarios
- ✅ Systems that run with minimal decision-making
- ✅ A playbook that someone else could actually follow
- ✅ 10-15+ hours saved weekly on "figuring things out"

### What Happens Next

Once your operations are documented and templated:

1. **You reclaim focus** — No more mental energy spent remembering procedures
2. **You enable delegation** — Anyone can follow your documented processes
3. **You improve quality** — Consistency comes from documentation
4. **You scale** — Your business grows beyond your personal capacity
5. **You take real time off** — Your business runs without you

## Before You Start Phase 1

### Mindset Shift Required

You're not documenting to make yourself obsolete. You're documenting so you can focus on what only you can do:

- Strategic decisions
- Client relationships
- Creative work
- Business growth
- Time with family

The mundane, repeatable tasks that currently consume 30-40% of your time? Those get documented so you can delegate them or process them on autopilot.

### What You'll Need

- Notion, Google Docs, or a documentation tool (free options available)
- 2-3 hours per week for documentation
- Honest assessment of your actual processes (not how you think you do them)
- Willingness to systemize things that feel creative or personalized

### The Big Picture

Week 02 taught you how to manage email and time through systems and boundaries. Week 03 takes that principle and applies it to your entire business. Every decision becomes a decision framework. Every process becomes a documented procedure. Every communication becomes a template.

The result? A business that runs on systems instead of your personal heroic effort.
