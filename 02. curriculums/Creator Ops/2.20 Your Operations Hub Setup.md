### **Hub Architecture Customization**

Your Operations Hub includes several key sections:

1. **Dashboard**: Your at-a-glance view of critical information
2. **Content System**: Everything related to content planning and creation

4. **Business Metrics**: Your performance indicators and goals
5. **Resources**: Templates, SOPs, and reference materials

Let's customize each section to match your specific business needs, starting with your Dashboard.

### **Dashboard Configuration**

Your dashboard should answer the most important questions in your business at a glance:

- What content is in progress?
- What tasks need attention today?
- How are my key metrics trending?
- What's coming up in my schedule?

Using the information from your Operations Audit in Module 1, we'll configure your dashboard to show your highest priority information.

1. **Content Database Customization**

    - Create views for different planning and production stages
2. **Task Database Customization**
    - Set up task categories specific to your business
    - Configure priority levels and time estimates
    - Connect tasks to content and projects
    - Create views for daily, weekly, and project-based work
