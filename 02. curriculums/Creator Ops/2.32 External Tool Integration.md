### Step 1: Calendar Integration with Notion Calendar

Notion Calendar is a standalone calendar app built to work seamlessly with your Notion databases. It allows you to:

- View and schedule items from your Notion databases in a calendar interface
- Drag and drop tasks or content ideas to reschedule
- See Notion pages alongside Google Calendar events

**How to use it:**

1. Download **Notion Calendar** at notion.so/calendar and connect it to your Notion and Google accounts.
2. Choose a Notion database that includes a date property (like your Content Calendar).
3. Map your Notion database to display content items directly inside the calendar.
4. Toggle between views (day, week, month) and filter by properties like Platform or Status.
5. Add new content or events directly from the calendar view—these will sync back to Notion.

This gives you a full-picture planning view without having to switch tools.

### Step 2: Send to Notion via Chrome Extension

Quickly capture ideas, research, or inspiration from the web using the "Save to Notion" Chrome extension.

1. Install the "[Save to Notion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm)" extension from the Chrome Web Store. Log in with your Notion account.
2. Choose your Content Ideas database as the destination. Customize fields like Title, Tags, Platform, and Notes for each new entry.
3. Use the extension to save articles, tweets, or YouTube links directly into your Content Ideas database while browsing.
4. Set up different templates in the extension for various idea types—like video scripts, blog prompts, or product reviews.

### Step 3: Zapier/Make Connections (Optional)

1. Sign up for Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat)
2. Create a basic connection:
    - When YouTube video is published → Add to Content Library
    - When Instagram post gets above-average engagement → Add to "High Performers" database
    - When new subscriber joins your email list → Add to Audience database
