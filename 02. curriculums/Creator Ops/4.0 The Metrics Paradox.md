As creators, we often find ourselves drowning in data while starving for insights. Platform dashboards show hundreds of metrics, but rarely answer the most important question: "What should I do differently?"

The problem isn't lack of data—it's lack of a framework to translate numbers into actions. In this module, we're going to transform how you track, understand, and actually use metrics in your creator business.

### Moving Beyond Vanity Metrics

Before we build your metrics systems, let's address a critical mindset shift:

**Vanity metrics** feel good but don't drive decisions. They include:

- Total followers/subscribers (without context)
- Video views without engagement rates
- Email list size without open rates
- Social media impressions without conversions

**Decision metrics** directly inform what you should do next:

- Content engagement patterns by topic or format
- Conversion rates from different traffic sources
- Revenue attribution by content piece
- Growth trajectory rather than absolute numbers

Our goal is to build systems that track metrics that actually matter for your specific business model.

### What You'll Build in This Module

By the end of this module, you'll have:

1. A customized Creator KPIs Framework tailored to your business
2. Streamlined tracking systems that reduce data overwhelm
3. Clear connections between content performance and revenue
4. A 15-minute weekly review system that turns data into decisions

Let's start by building your Creator KPIs Framework.
