## Content-to-Revenue

For professional creators, the most valuable metric is understanding which content actually generates revenue. Let's build a system to track exactly that.

### Step 1: Create Your Revenue Attribution Database

Create a new database called "Revenue Attribution" with these properties:

- **Date**: When the revenue came in (Date)
- **Customer/Client**: Who paid you (Text)
- **Amount**: How much you earned (Number)
- **Revenue Stream**: Type of income (Select: Product, Service, Sponsorship, etc.)
- **First Touch Content**: What content first brought them to you (Relation to Content Performance)
- **Converting Content**: What content directly led to the sale (Relation to Content Performance)
- **Customer Journey Notes**: Details about their path (Text)

### Step 2: Build Your Content Revenue Analysis View

Create a view that shows which content actually generates money:

- Table view grouped by Converting Content
- Calculate total revenue per content piece
- Sort by total revenue (descending)
- Add columns showing content type and topic

This view answers the golden question: "Which specific content actually makes me money?"

I recently helped a cooking creator implement this system, and she discovered that while her dessert recipes got the most likes, her meal prep videos generated 80% of her course sales. Talk about a content strategy revelation!

### Step 3: Create Your Content Gold Mine Report

Create a "Content Gold Mine" page that links:

- Your top 5 revenue-generating content pieces
- Analysis of common elements between them
- Direct action items for creating more similar content

This is where the magic happens—connecting specific content attributes directly to your bank account.
