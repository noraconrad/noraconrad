I created this course to be a DIY version of my sprints - I know this isn’t for everyone.

Building advanced systems like the ones covered in Module 6 requires time, technical skill, and focused attention—resources that many busy creators simply don't have. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the complexity or finding yourself stuck in implementation, you're not alone.

## Get Help Building Your Systems

**Introducing 1:1 Sprint Sessions** - Work directly with me to build, optimize, and automate your creator operations systems in record time.

As a course member, you can apply your **$297 course credit** toward any sprint package and get personalized help implementing everything you've learned.

### Why Creators Choose 1:1 Sprints:

- **Done-With-You Implementation**: No more guessing if you've set things up correctly—we'll build your systems together in real-time
- **Customized to Your Business**: Your content business has unique needs that generic templates can't address
- **Accelerated Results**: Compress months of trial-and-error into days of focused implementation
- **Systems That Scale With You**: Build foundations that support your growth instead of becoming bottlenecks

## The Core Sprint: 72-Hour Operations Overhaul

Our most popular option is the Core Sprint: a 72-hour intensive session where we'll clean up, organize, and automate your entire operations stack.

- **Content-to-Revenue Attribution System** custom-built for your specific business model
- **Comprehensive Notion Command Center** that brings all your metrics and decisions into one place
- **Automated Workflows** that capture data without manual entry
- **Custom Dashboards** that surface the insights most relevant to your business
- **90 Days of Follow-Up Support** to ensure everything continues working smoothly

After just three days of focused work together, you'll have clarity, confidence, and control over your content business operations.

## What Past Participants Say:

> "I was drowning in spreadsheets and guessing which content was actually making money. After our sprint, I now have clear visibility into exactly which videos drive sales, which has completely transformed my content strategy. In just 30 days using the new system, my revenue is up 32% while creating LESS content." — Emma K., Fitness Creator

> "I was skeptical about whether someone could really understand my business systems in just a few days. Not only did we build better systems than I could have imagined, but the ongoing support helped me actually stick with them. This has been the best investment I've made in my business operations." — Marcus T., Online Course Creator
