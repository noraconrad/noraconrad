The best system in the world is useless without a consistent practice. Let's create a simple 15-minute review process you'll actually stick with.

### Step 1: Create Your Weekly Review Template

In Notion, create a template called "Weekly Content Performance Review" with these sections:

**This Week's Content Performance**

- Linked view of content published this week
- Space to note the top and bottom performers

**Content Patterns Analysis**

- Specific questions to answer:
    - "Which topics performed best this week?"
    - "Which content formats resonated most?"
    - "What specific elements seemed to drive engagement?"
    - "Did any content directly lead to revenue?"

**Next Week's Content Plan**

- Space to list content pieces for next week based on insights
- Specific rationale for each content decision

**Experiments to Try**

- Space to document one content experiment to test next week

### Step 2: Schedule Your Non-Negotiable Review Time

The key to making this work is consistency:

1. Block 15 minutes every Sunday (or your preferred day) specifically for this review
2. Make it a calendar appointment with a reminder
3. Have a specific trigger that reminds you (I use Sunday morning coffee)

### Step 3: Turn Insights Into Content Actions

End every review by creating specific content tasks based on your insights:

- **Create content task cards** in your project management system
- **Specifically note why** you're creating each piece based on data
- **Estimate ROI** for each content piece before creating it
