When I started creating content in 2011, I was disorganized. I posted based on emotion and energy levels - which worked out when I was young with lots of free time. However, by 2018 when my first baby was born, I found myself drowning in tasks, constantly missing deadlines, and watching important details fall through the cracks. My content was inconsistent, my client work was chaotic, and my income reflected this disorder. I was working 50+ hours a week but seeing minimal results.

The turning point came while I was taking business operations classes. I realized that my creativity wasn't the problem, my operations were. Even as a solopreneur, I found I could benefit from the same systems multi-million dollar businesses used. I began obsessively studying systems from both traditional businesses and successful creators, adapting and implementing what worked while discarding what didn't.

By the time my second baby was born, I was working for myself full-time. Today, my business runs on carefully designed systems that allow me to focus on high-impact work while maintaining consistency across all aspects of my operation. This course distills everything I've learned through years of trial and error into a practical framework you can implement immediately.
