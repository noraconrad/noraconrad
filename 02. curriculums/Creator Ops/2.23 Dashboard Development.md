### Step 1: Identify Essential Dashboard Components

1. List the 3-5 most important pieces of information you need to see daily
2. Consider including:
    - Content in progress
    - Upcoming deadlines
    - Priority tasks
    - Key metrics snapshot
    - Monthly income progress

### Step 2: Configure the Dashboard Layout

1. Navigate to your Dashboard page
2. Remove any template elements that aren't relevant to your business
3. Arrange the remaining elements in order of importance (top to bottom)

### Step 3: Add Content Pipeline Visualization

1. On your Dashboard, add a linked database view of your Content system:
    - Type /linked and select "Create a linked database"
    - Select your Content Database
    - Choose the "Board" view grouped by Status
    - Filter to show only active content (exclude "Published" and "Archived")
    - Adjust the properties shown on cards to include essentials like due dates

### Step 4: Add Task Priority View

1. Add another linked database for your Tasks:
    - Type /linked and select "Create a linked database"
    - Select your Task Database
    - Choose the "List" view
    - Sort by Priority (High to Low) and then by Due Date
    - Filter to show only incomplete tasks
    - Limit to 5-10 items to prevent overwhelm

### Step 5: Add Key Metrics Display

1. Add a linked database for your Metrics:
    - Select only the most important 3-5 metrics
    - Create a "This Month vs. Last Month" comparison view
    - Use inline functions to calculate percentage changes
