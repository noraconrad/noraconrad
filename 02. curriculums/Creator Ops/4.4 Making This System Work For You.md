### Why One-Size-Fits-All Metrics Fail Creators

Different creator business models require fundamentally different metrics focus:

- Ad-supported creators need to optimize for watch time and audience growth
- Service providers need to track leads and conversion rates
- Product sellers need to monitor sales funnels and customer acquisition costs
- Membership creators need to focus on retention and engagement

Using metrics designed for a different business model leads to misguided decisions and wasted effort. This lesson helps you customize your metrics system to perfectly match your specific creator business.

## Define Your Core Business Model

Before customizing your metrics, clearly define your primary revenue model:

**Business Model Classification Framework**

Create a Notion page called "My Creator Business Model" with these sections:

1. **Primary Revenue Streams**
    - List all current income sources
    - Calculate percentage of total revenue for each
    - Identify your "dominant" business model (generating >50% of revenue)
    - Document secondary and aspiring revenue streams
2. **Business Model Evolution Timeline**
    - Document your current business model stage
    - Outline planned evolution over next 12 months
    - Note metrics implications of planned changes
    - Create transition triggers for metrics system updates
3. **Critical Success Factors**
    - Identify 3-5 factors most critical to your business success
    - Link each factor to specific measurable metrics
    - Rate their current performance (Red/Yellow/Green)
    - Document improvement priorities
4. **Decision Support Needs**
    - List key business decisions you make regularly
    - Identify information needed for each decision
    - Document current information gaps
    - Prioritize metrics based on decision impact
