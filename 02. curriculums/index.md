Around 2015 I sold my first course: VA in 7 Days. It was $19 and I sold somewhere around 90 seats. I had no idea that people would actually want to pay me for my experience and it opened a whole world for me. 

Since then, I have launched over a dozen course in various small-business topics. I retired some, re-wrote others. One of my most expensive courses sold for $895 per seat. Today you can get all my retired, re-written and once-expensive courses for free. 

While I no longer update these as I once did, and some of the tech tips may be past their prime, I hope the information is valuable for you and the consolidation of it all helps you in whatever stage you're at ❤️
