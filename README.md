# Steph Nora Conrad

**Operations & Analytics Engineer**

I build data systems that actually ship. Over 13 years in CPG, I've shifted from traditional data and ops consulting to directly engineering the tools my clients need—combining no-code platforms, AI automation, and frontend development to move from analysis to actionable infrastructure.

## What I Do

**Dashboards & Analytics Systems** — Real-time dashboards built on Supabase and Vercel that replace hours of weekly manual reporting. I design for the actual workflow, not the ideal one.

**WMS & ERP Systems** — Inventory management, demand planning, and fulfillment operations tooling. Usually, replacing fragmented spreadsheets and expensive legacy platforms.

**Data Infrastructure** — Schema design, ETL pipelines, API integrations. I work across Shopify, retailer portals, ERP systems, and financial data to create single sources of truth.

## For Small Teams Without the Budget

Most inventory management and operational systems cost thousands monthly and require IT support to implement. I build them in Notion and Web Apps instead.

Your team starts using the system tomorrow. No onboarding consultants, no learning curve, no integrations nightmare. A simple web form becomes your order intake. Notion databases become your project hub. Everything connects to what your team already uses.

I design these systems so you can actually modify them—add fields, adjust workflows, optimize processes without waiting for a developer. The tool becomes flexible, not a constraint.

This approach works for fulfillment operations, inventory reconciliation, demand planning, and sales analytics. It costs a fraction of legacy software and gives you the visibility to make better decisions immediately.

## How I Work

I bridge the gap between what data shows and what businesses need to do with it. My toolkit: SQL, JavaScript/React for custom interfaces, Supabase for backend infrastructure, and AI no-code tools for rapid iteration. This combo lets me ship faster than building everything custom and cheaper than traditional SaaS solutions.

Currently working with **[Ardor Energy](https://ardorenergy.com/)** on analytics infrastructure and **[MacPac Fulfillment](https://www.macpacfulfillment.com/)** on a custom warehouse management system.
