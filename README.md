# Steph Nora Conrad

**Operations & Analytics Engineer**

I build data systems that work out of the box. Over 13 years in CPG, I've shifted from traditional data and ops consulting to directly engineering the tools my clients need—combining no-code platforms, AI automation, and frontend development to move from analysis to actionable infrastructure.


## What I Do

**Dashboards & Analytics Systems** — Real-time dashboards built on Supabase and Vercel that replace hours of weekly manual reporting. I design for the actual workflow, not the ideal one.

**WMS & ERP Systems** — Inventory management, demand planning, and fulfillment operations tooling. Usually, replacing fragmented spreadsheets and expensive legacy platforms.

**Data Infrastructure** — Schema design, ETL pipelines, API integrations. I work across Shopify, retailer portals, ERP systems, and financial data to create single sources of truth.


## How I Work

I bridge the gap between what data shows and what businesses need to do with it. My toolkit: SQL, JavaScript/React for custom interfaces, Supabase for backend infrastructure, and AI no-code tools for rapid iteration. This combo lets me ship faster than building everything custom and cheaper than traditional SaaS solutions.

Currently working with **[Ardor Energy](https://ardorenergy.com/)** on analytics infrastructure and **[MacPac Fulfillment](https://www.macpacfulfillment.com/)** on a custom warehouse management system.
