I'm migrating my scattered content ecosystem into a single knowledge garden. This is a public roadmap of the work involved.

**Why?** 

After starting a full-time job, I realized I don't need a content machine, I need a sustainable way to share what I've learned. I'm consolidating 300+ blog posts, a decade of YouTube content, templates, and resources into one text-based, low-pressure space. No algorithms. No social media fragmentation. Just a garden I tend to.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] Create new public Obsidian vault (separate from my private notes)
- [x] Set up folder structure:
    - `01. Posts/`
    - `02. Curriculums/`
    - `03. Templates/`
    - `04. Random Rambles/`
    - `Index.md`
- [x] Create YAML frontmatter template/boilerplate (default for all pages)
- [x] Initialize Git repo and push to GitHub
- [x] Clone Quartz, connect to GitHub repo
- [x] Deploy to Vercel and verify it works (even with empty vault)
- [x] Review [Quartz philosophy](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy) and customize homepage layout

## Phase 2: Content Migration

- [ ] Export all blog posts from Squarespace and convert to Markdown
- [ ] Export/migrate posts from Medium
- [ ] Bulk add YAML frontmatter to all posts (I'll script this)
- [ ] Organize posts into `/Posts` folder with consistent naming
- [ ] Add tags to each post in frontmatter (e.g., `tags: [productivity, small-business]`)
- [ ] Move template products into `/Template` folder with YAML metadata
- [ ] Move curriculum content into `/Curriculums` folder
- [ ] Test Quartz build locally
- [ ] Gradually clean up/update old posts as time allows (new images, updated links, refreshed context)

## Phase 3: Site Architecture & Features

- [x] Create custom Index.md homepage (directory/hub layout)
- [ ] Create `/About` page (portfolio of projects, origin story, why I shifted)
- [ ] Create `/Support` page listing:
    - Affiliate links
    - Paid templates (Lemonsqueezy/Stripe links)
    - Donate button (Ko-fi or similar)
- [ ] Add social sidebar to Quartz layout:
    - YouTube
    - LinkedIn
    - Pinterest
    - Email signup (Kit)
- [ ] Set up Kit email signup form (embed on Index or dedicated page)
- [ ] Configure Lemonsqueezy or Stripe for paid template sales
- [ ] Set up tag-based navigation (so people can browse by topic rather than chronological feed)

## Phase 4: Polish & Launch

- [ ] Test all links work (internal and external)
- [ ] Verify email signup connects to Kit properly
- [ ] Configure Quartz settings (site title, description, social links, favicon)
- [ ] Set up and route my domain (noraconrad.com)
- [ ] Performance testing and load time optimization
- [ ] Push to production on Vercel

## Bonus: Building in Public

- [ ] Record & edit YouTube video: "I got a job"
    - Timeline: been on YouTube since high school, periods of full-time income, where it's at now
    - The shift: from content farm to knowledge garden
    - What changes: sparse uploads (tutorials + updates only), site is text-based, no algorithm chasing
    - What doesn't change: still building in public, still creating, still here
    - Link to new site + philosophy
- [ ] Write a post documenting this entire shift (philosophy, tech choices, lessons learned) - this is in progress now 😉
- [ ] Share updates with email list as site develops

## Ongoing

- [ ] Migrate remaining posts incrementally (no deadline)
- [ ] Update/refresh old posts as I revisit them
- [ ] Write new posts and book reviews when inspired
- [ ] Maintain email newsletter on Kit (send occasionally, not on a schedule)
- [ ] Keep YouTube sparse: tutorials and updates only

## Current Setup (Being Replaced)

- Squarespace blog (300+ posts)
- Medium (300+ posts, generates ~$50-100/mo)
- Kit (email list with thousands of subscribers, ~$100-200/year)
- Shopify (not actively used)
- YouTube (8,000 subscribers, 200+ videos)
- Various other tools/subscriptions

**New Setup:**

- Obsidian vault (free, local)
- Quartz (free, open-source)
- Vercel (free tier)
- Kit (already paid for the year)
- Medium (free, keeps passive income)
- YouTube (free)

**Annual costs after migration:** ~$8/mo (Kit) + domain = ~$100-120/year. Down from $300+/month.

## Why This Approach?

I spent years optimizing for metrics: views, subscribers, revenue per 1,000 impressions. It worked for a while, but it also meant constantly chasing what the algorithm wanted rather than what I actually wanted to share. It resulted in poor quality content, stress and - to be completely honest - a lot of fun too. But it's time to evolve.

A knowledge garden is different. It's:

- **Owned by me** (my domain, my Obsidian vault, not dependent on a platform)
- **Built for people, not algorithms** (no infinite scroll, no push notifications, no engagement metrics, no SEO focus)
- **Low maintenance** (one static site, one email list, sparse updates)
- **Long-term sustainable** (I can maintain this for decades without burnout)
- **Text-first** (writing ages better than videos; it's searchable, quotable, linkable)

This mirrors the philosophy of a "digital garden" - intentional, slowly grown, occasionally pruned, always evolving.
