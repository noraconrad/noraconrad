description: Everything here is free. These are the ways you can help if you'd like to.
---
Everything I create here is completely free, no paywalls, no gatekeeping, no courses to buy. I used to charge for courses and offered one-on-one services, but I've moved away from that model entirely. Now this is a side project where I share what I've learned because I believe knowledge shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.

I'm still working to convert more of my paid resources into free versions, and I've already made as much as I can available without cost. This shift means I'm not generating income from my content anymore, which is intentional, it's part of building something sustainable alongside my full-time job.

**If you find value in what I create, here are two ways you can support me:**

**Use my affiliate links** when you're already planning to buy something. I've partnered with most of these companies for years and genuinely use their products daily. When you purchase through my links, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This is the most meaningful way to support my work.

**Send me a coffee** if you'd prefer a direct contribution. No strings attached.
