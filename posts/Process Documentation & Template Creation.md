## The Foundation of Your Operations Manual

This phase is about capturing what's currently in your head and getting it on paper (or in Notion). You're creating a master inventory of every repeating process in your business, then building templates and documentation for each one.

> [!info]
> You're not trying to be perfect. You're trying to be clear enough that someone else—or future you—could follow the instructions and get the same result.

---

## Step 1: Brain Dump All Your Recurring Tasks

Spend 1-2 hours tracking what you actually do. Write down every task you repeat more than once per month. Don't organize yet—just brain dump.

Then categorize everything into these buckets:

### Client Management

- Initial inquiry response process
- Discovery call preparation and follow-up
- Proposal creation and delivery
- Contract negotiation and signing
- Project onboarding sequence
- Regular client communication and updates
- Project completion and handoff
- Client offboarding and relationship maintenance
- Testimonial/referral requests
- Upsell or additional service outreach

### Business Operations

- Lead generation and nurturing
- Content creation and posting
- Social media management
- Email marketing campaigns
- Financial tracking and invoicing
- Vendor management and payments
- Technology maintenance and updates
- Legal compliance and documentation
- Business goal planning and reviews
- Pricing decisions and adjustments

### Administrative Tasks

- File organization and storage
- Calendar management and scheduling
- Email management and responses
- Customer service inquiries
- Refund and cancellation processes
- Partnership and collaboration coordination
- Supplier/contractor communication
- Time tracking and billing

---

## Step 2: The Master Process Inventory

### Create Your List

Once you've brain-dumped everything, create a master inventory of your top 25-30 processes. Here's what to include for each:

**Process Name:** [Clear, specific title]  
**Category:** [Client Management / Business Operations / Administrative]  
**Frequency:** [Daily / Weekly / Per client / Monthly / As needed]  
**Time Required:** [Current time spent]  
**Complexity:** [Simple / Medium / Complex]  
**Revenue Impact:** [High / Medium / Low]

### Prioritize for Documentation

Start documenting in this order:

**Priority 1 (Document First):**
- High revenue impact processes
- Frequent tasks (3+ times per week)
- Tasks taking 15+ minutes each
- Client-facing processes
- Example: Proposal creation, client onboarding, invoicing

**Priority 2 (Document Second):**
- Medium frequency (1-2 times per week)
- Medium complexity tasks
- Operational tasks affecting business stability
- Example: Email management, content scheduling, vendor communication

**Priority 3 (Document Later):**
- Infrequent tasks
- Low complexity
- Low revenue impact
- Example: Quarterly planning, annual reviews

## Step 3: The Documentation Template Structure

### Use This Template for Every Process

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Step 4: Real-World Example

### Example Process: Client Proposal Creation

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROCESS NAME: Create & Deliver Client Proposal
CATEGORY: Client Management
PURPOSE: Provide professional, customized proposal that converts prospects to paid clients
FREQUENCY: Per new client inquiry (typically 2-4 per week)
OWNER: Nora (currently); can be delegated to virtual assistant
TIME REQUIRED: 30 minutes using template; 2+ hours building from scratch

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOOLS & RESOURCES NEEDED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Software: Google Docs (proposal template), Calendly (scheduling link), Gmail
Templates: "Master Proposal Template" (shared folder: /Proposals/Templates)
Documents: Pricing guide, service descriptions, testimonials
Credentials: Access to Google Drive folder, email account

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Gather Information
   - Open "Prospect Notes" document where prospect inquiry was documented
   - Identify: Project type, client industry, stated budget (if any), timeline
   - Review: Any previous conversations or meetings with this prospect
   - Check: Client's website/social media for context

2. Open Master Proposal Template
   - Go to Google Drive: /Proposals/Templates
   - Find template matching project type (e.g., "Website Design Proposal")
   - Click "Make a Copy" and name it: "[Client Name] - [Project Type] Proposal"
   - Share with client immediately (read access only)

3. Customize Header Section
   - Client Name: [Full legal name as they want it]
   - Date: [Today's date]
   - Project Name: [What they called it OR professional title]
   - Proposal Valid Until: [30 days from today]

4. Complete Project Overview Section
   - Copy client's stated project goal from inquiry
   - Rephrase in professional language (not copy/paste their words)
   - Keep to 2-3 sentences maximum
   - Include: What problem you're solving, what success looks like

5. Detail Deliverables Section
   - List exactly what you're delivering
   - Be specific: "3 rounds of revisions" not "unlimited revisions"
   - Include timeline: "Delivered by [specific date]"
   - Note what's NOT included if relevant: "Logo design is not included"

6. Add Investment Section
   - Calculate total cost using "Pricing Guide" document
   - Break down: Deposit [X], Remaining balance [Y], Total [Z]
   - Payment terms: "50% deposit due to start, 50% balance due upon delivery"
   - Payment methods: List available options (Stripe link, bank transfer, etc.)
   - If monthly retainer: Detail what month 1 includes and ongoing monthly deliverables

7. Include Timeline Section
   - Project start date: [When work begins after contract signed]
   - Major milestones with dates
   - Project completion date
   - Revisions timeline if applicable
   - Post-launch support period (if applicable)

8. Add Next Steps Section
   - "To move forward, reply 'approved' and I'll send the contract"
   - Include scheduling link: [Insert Calendly link for consultation call]
   - Set expectation: "Proposal valid for 30 days"
   - Provide way to ask questions: "Reply here or call [phone number]"

9. Insert Testimonials/Case Study (if relevant)
   - Add 1-2 testimonials from similar client types
   - Include: Client name, what you delivered, result they got
   - Keep each to 2-3 sentences maximum

10. Final Quality Check
    - Spelling/grammar check (use Grammarly or spell-check)
    - All placeholder [brackets] removed
    - Pricing calculated correctly
    - All links working and directing to correct places
    - Dates match what was discussed
    - Professional formatting (consistent fonts, spacing, colors)

11. Send to Client
    - Use email template: "02-SALES-Proposal-Delivery" from email templates
    - Attach PDF version (File → Download → PDF Document)
    - Send at time they're likely to read it (typically 10 AM their time)
    - Use email scheduling if not sending immediately
    - Follow-up sequence will auto-trigger in 3 days if no response

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DECISION POINTS & CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If client has stated budget → Use that as anchor for proposal pricing
If client has NO stated budget → Use standard pricing from Pricing Guide
If project seems rushed (tight deadline) → Add rush fee (25% premium)
If prospect is referral from happy client → Consider 10% referral discount
If this is new service area for you → Keep scope tight; proposal is lower than usual price

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
QUALITY CHECK: HOW TO VERIFY SUCCESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ All client name/project details spelled correctly
✓ Pricing is clearly stated and broken down
✓ Timeline includes specific dates (not "2-3 weeks")
✓ Deliverables are specific enough that client knows what they're getting
✓ Tone is professional but friendly (matches your brand)
✓ No typos or grammatical errors
✓ Document is saved and shared with client
✓ Follow-up sequence is set to trigger

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mistake 1: Overcomplicating deliverables
→ Prevention: Use simple language client understands; avoid industry jargon

Mistake 2: Unclear timeline (using vague language like "2 weeks")
→ Prevention: Always include specific dates (not duration)

Mistake 3: Leaving placeholder text in the document
→ Prevention: Do final proofread searching for [brackets]

Mistake 4: Underpricing because you want the project
→ Prevention: Follow pricing guide; if you feel tempted to discount, wait 24 hours

Mistake 5: Making deliverables unlimited (e.g., "unlimited revisions")
→ Prevention: Always specify number of revision rounds (typically 2-3)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If client asks about discount → "I can adjust scope instead to fit your budget"
If client wants unlimited revisions → "I offer 3 revision rounds; additional rounds are $[X] each"
If you're not sure about pricing → Check Pricing Guide document or ask in team Slack
If proposal isn't converting → Track response rate and experiment with different language/structure
If client says yes but doesn't sign contract → Follow up after 3 days with contract and payment link

## Step 5: Create 5-8 Process Documents This Week

Focus on your highest-impact processes first:

**Top Priority (Start Here):**
1. Initial client inquiry response
2. Proposal creation and delivery
3. Contract preparation and signing
4. Project onboarding
5. Invoice creation and payment collection

**Secondary Priority (If Time):**
6. Content planning and creation
7. Email marketing campaigns
8. Monthly financial review

> [!tip]
> Don't aim for perfection. Aim for "clear enough that someone else could do this." You can refine them next week.

---

## Step 6: Organization & Storage

### Where to Keep Your Documentation

**Option 1: Notion (Recommended)**
- Central database with all processes
- Easy to search and cross-link
- Can be shared with team members
- Free plan is sufficient

**Option 2: Google Docs**
- Simple shared folder structure
- Easy to comment and collaborate
- Less searchable than Notion

**Option 3: Obsidian (Since you're using it!)**
- Keep in your vault as markdown files
- Folder structure: `03. templates/operations/`
- Easy to link between processes
- Version controlled with Git

### Folder Structure Example (Notion or Google Drive)

## Step 7: The Process Documentation Checklist

For each process you document, ensure:

- [ ] Process name is clear and specific
- [ ] Purpose explains why this process exists
- [ ] Tools/resources listed with exact names and access info
- [ ] Every step is specific enough someone else could follow it
- [ ] Decision points include clear criteria (not vague language)
- [ ] Quality check describes what success looks like
- [ ] Common mistakes are documented with prevention tips
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers likely failure scenarios
- [ ] Related processes are linked
- [ ] Last updated date is current
- [ ] No jargon or "obvious" steps skipped
- [ ] Templates are linked if used

---

## Week 03 Phase 1 Success Indicators

By end of this phase, you should have:

✅ Master inventory of 25-30 recurring business processes  
✅ 5-8 process documents completed using the template  
✅ All high-revenue processes documented  
✅ Central location for all documentation (Notion/Google Drive/Obsidian)  
✅ Decision frameworks for common business decisions  
✅ Links between related processes  

### The Big Win

You'll realize: "Oh, I've been doing this the same way every time, but I've never written it down." That's the moment when documentation becomes powerful. You go from holding everything in your head to having a playbook.

---

## Before You Move to Phase 2

### Reflect on These Questions

1. Which processes took the longest to document? (These are often the most valuable ones)
2. Did documenting processes reveal any inefficiencies in how you work?
3. Are there processes you do inconsistently? (Documentation will fix this)
4. Which processes could someone else do tomorrow if you had documentation?

### Common Challenges

**"This is taking longer than expected"**
→ Start with simpler processes first; build momentum

**"I'm not sure how to phrase these steps"**
→ Write like you're texting a friend; be conversational

**"My process changes every time"**
→ That's the problem you're solving; document the ideal version

**"I can't decide if a step is too detailed or not detailed enough"**
→ Ask: "Could someone with basic business skills follow this and get the same result?" If yes, it's detailed enough.

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 2 builds on this foundation by creating a comprehensive **Email Template Database** for complex client scenarios. Once you understand your processes, you'll template the communications that happen within them.

The progression is:
1. **Phase 1 (This):** Map and document your core processes
2. **Phase 2:** Create templates for complex client communications
3. **Phase 3:** Create legal documents and contracts
4. **Phase 4:** Create customer service decision frameworks
5. **Phase 5:** Set up forms and automation
6. **Phase 6:** Test everything and refine

---

## Before You Move to Phase 2

Complete these items:

- [ ] Created master inventory of 25-30 processes
- [ ] Documented 5-8 high-priority processes using the template
- [ ] Set up central location for documentation
- [ ] Linked related processes together
- [ ] Reviewed documentation for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Tested at least one process document with a real task

> [!info]
> You've just documented the foundation of your business. Even if you never delegate, this documentation will save you hundreds of hours and prevent countless mistakes. You've built something valuable.
