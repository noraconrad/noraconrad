#### This new feature has made me a customer for life.

I’ve been using [Sunsama](https://try.sunsama.com/noraconrad) since Sept 14th, 2021. Since that time, I have fallen completely in love with the app. I am a huge fan of the company as a whole, as they have consistently pushed new and thoughtful features over the years, maintained transparency in their roadmap, and added some really useful integrations. 

I’ve been an affiliate since 2021 and used the app almost every day since. **Some of the links to Sunsama are affiliate links** if you’re interested in testing it out for yourself. [Like this one](https://try.sunsama.com/noraconrad).

**This week, I got to try out one of their newest integrations on Beta, the Voice and Text AI Assistant.**

One of my biggest complaints about Sunsama has been that I hate using the phone app to enter data. I am not a phone user 99% of the time. If I’m doing work, I’m using my desktop, and most of the time I plan my day in the mornings with little friction. However, I will get a random string of thoughts about tasks that need to be done, and entering a brain dump in the app is not my cup of tea. I’ve used the ToDoist integration, but it’s not my ideal setup.

**_Enter: Voice and Text AI Assistant._** There are two main options within this feature:

1. **Get a daily call to plan your day  
    **Sunsama can call to help you plan your day over the phone. Using AI, you can ramble off the tasks at hand, and add in details like due date, estimated time to complete, and context for the tasks. This method makes my brain so SO happy. Speaking tasks out loud is my favorite way to clear my mind. And much to my husband’s delight, I can now use this feature instead of _his_ ear.
2. **Text your assistant  
    **You can text your Sunsama assistant to adjust your tasks, add things to your schedule, and more. This is perfect for 11:32 pm, when I have those three tasks pestering my sleepy mind, and I need to throw some quick ideas down then worry about the details later. Call Mark, schedule dentist apts, and pick up meds.
