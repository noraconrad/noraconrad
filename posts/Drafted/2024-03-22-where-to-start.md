# You don't need a million apps and organizational tools to get organized. 

### Here's a complete list of the tools I use every single day to manage my schedule and get my work done.

**HERE'S A COMPLETE LIST OF THE TOOLS I USE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MANAGE MY SCHEDULE AND GET MY WORK DONE.**

- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) - This is always open to plan my day, send meeting invites and plan meals
    
- [Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) - I have all my email accounts (work and personal) going into one Gmail account
    
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) - My digital filing cabinet, content planner, and all my files
    
- [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) - Storing photos and videos, and backing up my YouTube videos
    
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so?r=ce675808bfa2) - For keeping track of tasks, projects, and basically everything in my life (including this site)
    
- [Sunsama](https://get.sunsama.com/nora) - For keeping my tasks organized and my days under control
    

Of course, there are tools I use outside of these (like Wave accounting or Squarespace), but these six apps are the basics that I use every day. They're simple to use and all of them have apps and desktop versions that sync seamlessly. If you want to learn how to use each of these tools, check out the [course](https://shop.noraconrad.com/the-conrad-hub).

The trick to decluttering is to say no to free "gifts" from friends/hand-me-downs/free samples at the store. Unsubscribe from shopping newsletters that entice you to buy things you don't need. Stop shopping when you're bored. Once you stop bringing too many things into your home, you can start to get rid of the things you don't love and use. Touch every single item in your home. If you don't love it or use it, get rid of it.
