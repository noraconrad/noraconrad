#### Building a dashboard that sparks creativity

I’ve been using Notion for over five years, and I practically live in it. I’ve evolved my dashboards and setup over time, and I’ve purchased and made dozens of templates. A couple of years ago I invested in the Thomas Frank Ultimate Brain template with the Content Creator addition. It was a really fantastic investment, but after using it for awhile, it’s time to adapt it to my own needs.

#### How to approach a Notion build

1. Ask yourself, “What do I need this to do for me?”
2. Outline the main elements needed to make it work
3. Ask yourself, “Can I simplify this?”
4. Configure the database map and build what you need
5. Test the thing
6. Simplify the thing
7. Keep testing and modifying

Here’s how I used this framework to build my Content Creation Dashboard…

### 01 What do I need

- A space to quickly enter content ideas and be able to organize them later (an inbox)
- A place for my content pillars, brand rules, identity, and overall business strategy
- A content calendar to plan the post dates and see how the content can interact together
- A place to track the stats and metrics of each content piece
- Templates to make video and blog creation easy
- An affiliate/partner database to track sponsorships and revenue associated with each post
- A list of my channels with the brand guidelines and rules for each organized (graphics, channel stats, etc)

### 02 Making it work

**_Content Database  
_**This holds the post date, status (idea, in progress, posted, dead), and metric tracking. Templates can live in this database for easy content creation and consistency.

**_Sponsorship Database  
_**This holds all the partners, affiliate links, and revenue data (this can be linked to my existing income tracker). This will be linked to the content database via relations and rollups.

**_Channel Database  
_**This is where each of my social accounts/branches of the business lives. Each channel is one page, with the information relating to that channel inside of each section. This will be linked to the content database via relations and rollups.

**_Content Pillars  
_**This database is a list of each content pillar with a short explanation of the content included in each type. This will be linked to the content database via relations and rollups.

**_Tasks Database  
_**This will track what needs to happen on each content piece. It will be displayed within the content database pages, so each page has a to-do list specific to that piece of content.

**_Keyword Research Database  
_**This is a huge list of potential keywords with metrics for each. This will be linked to the content database via relations and rollups so I can pre-plan each post around key terms.

### 03 Simplify
