Although I try my best to avoid industry jargon, there are many terms that can be helpful to use to best describe the process or situation. This glossary may help if you are new to these terms.

I'd be happy to create a comprehensive glossary of terms for your Creator Operations course. This will help students navigate the technical terminology used throughout the modules.
