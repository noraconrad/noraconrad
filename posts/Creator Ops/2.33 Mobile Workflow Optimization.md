While I prefer to use Notion mostly from my desktop, you will likely need to access your information from your phone at some point (or maybe you’re much younger than me and do everything from your phone, in which case, I feel old). Either way, setting up mobile optimized pages can be very helpful.

### Step 1: Configure Mobile Dashboard

1. Open your Notion mobile app
2. Create a new page called "Mobile Dashboard"
3. Add simple linked databases with minimal properties shown:
    - Today's Tasks (filtered to show only today's items)
    - Quick Capture button for ideas
    - Current Projects status
4. Add this page to your Favorites for easy access

### Step 2: Create Quick Capture Templates

1. Create pre-configured templates for common mobile captures:
    - Content Idea (with minimal required fields)
    - Task Reminder (with status and priority pre-set)
    - Audience Feedback (simplified version)
2. Make these templates accessible with 1-2 taps from your mobile dashboard

### Step 3: Configure Offline Access

Notion has teased some offline access features coming in 2025 - early 2026… in the meantime, [this article is a great starting point](https://notionist.app/notion-offline-guide-can-you-use-it) if you need to be able to work in Notion when you are not connected to the internet.

### Step 4: Optimize Notifications

1. In the mobile app settings, configure notifications:
    - Enable notifications for tasks due today
    - Enable notifications for comments on pages you're working on
    - Disable unnecessary notifications to prevent overwhelm
2. Set specific notification times aligned with your workflow
