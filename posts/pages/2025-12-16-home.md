# instead of consuming your life

**You need systems that work when kids are sick, life gets busy, and when you prioritize family over hustle. I'll show you how to organize your business, so you can focus on what matters.**

### **Balancing work, family, and faith  
doesn't have to feel like this:**

✘ You're juggling twelve tools just to stay on top of your tasks, deadlines, and schedule

✘ You spend more time figuring out what to do than actually doing it

✘ You've built momentum, but your routines can't keep up when real life happens

✘ You know you're dropping balls, but there's no time to stop and fix it

✘ You feel guilty when work bleeds into family time, but stressed when family interrupts work

## _Hi, I’m Nora_ 👋🏼

I've spent 13+ years building systems for $1-$10M brands, but I'm also a work-from-home mom with two young kids. I know what it's like to try to run a business while managing household chaos, navigating questions of faith, and prioritizing family over hustle culture.

Most productivity advice assumes you have childcare, an office, or flexibility. I create systems that work with real life: when kids are sick, when you're working around naps, and when "deep work for 4 hours" isn't realistic.

Let's build something different.
