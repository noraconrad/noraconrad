# a little about me…

After having my second baby, I was trying to run a business, spend time with my family, enjoy some hobbies, manage my mental health, and grow in my faith… and I was doing it all **_badly_**. I needed systems, routines, and tools that would take away some of the “admin” work and give me back my free time.

Now, I dedicate my time to helping others do the same. I teach overwhelmed business owners how to cultivate purposeful productivity and grow the seeds that truly matter. Here’s what I focus on:

**Achieving Your Goals Without Sacrificing Mental Health**  
Define what success looks like in your life and build strategies that align with your values and goals.

**Establish Productive Habits**  
Nurture habits that enhance your efficiency, so you can work just a few hours a day and still see your efforts bloom.

**Find Joy in the Mundane**  
Laundry has to be done, dinners need to be made, and the kids need a bath. Finding purpose and joy in the mundane things of life makes it so much sweeter.


# behind the scenes…

**_01 - I have been running online businesses since_** **_middle school_. I love business, and I really enjoy learning - but my success in both has not been traditional.**

I love taking courses and learning new skills, from coding to gouache painting; I’m always picking up a new hobby. I have taught and coached hundreds of women to launch their own businesses, and I’ve been creating YouTube videos since I was 17. I have worked as a logistics coordinator, executive assistant, operations manager, Amazon account director, and entrepreneur. I’ve worn a lot of hats, but my favorite one has been “mom”.

**_02 - I’ve got two beautiful kiddos, and I’m a wife to my high school sweetheart, DJ. We live with our two dogs, two cats, my parents and sisters just up the road, and my in-laws down the street - it makes for a very full, very loving house._**

I have two sisters, two sisters-in-law, a dozen cousins, and a huge family (all of whom I adore). We’re loud and a little crazy, but we love well, and cook even better. If you’ve ever been to one of our end-of-summer camp-outs or 4th of July BBQs, you’re part of the family.

**_03 - I was diagnosed with OCD and Bipolar Disorder at the ripe ol’ age of 30. Since then, I’ve become passionate about understanding the intersection of mental health and identity in Christ._**

Disclosing such serious health information publicly tends to raise eyebrows. While the diagnosis is still new to me, the disorders are not, and the more I can help to de-stigmatize this and other disorders like it, the better - especially in the Christian community.
