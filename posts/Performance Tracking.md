### The Goal of Tracking

Content isn't just about posting. It's about creating content that drives actual business results—leads, sales, connections, and growth.

This phase teaches you to measure what's working and optimize based on real data.

## Content Analytics Setup

### Key Metrics to Track by Platform

**Instagram Metrics:**
- Reach and impressions (how many people see your content)
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares as % of reach)
- Story completion rate (how far people watch your stories)
- Profile visits and website clicks
- Follower growth rate month-over-month

**LinkedIn Metrics:**
- Post engagement (likes, comments, shares)
- Profile views and connection requests from content
- Article views and engagement
- Lead generation directly from content
- Email signups from content

**YouTube Metrics:**
- View duration and audience retention (critical—longer is better)
- Subscriber growth from videos
- Click-through rate on thumbnails (should be 4-8%)
- Comments and engagement
- Traffic to website from videos

**Blog Metrics:**
- Organic search traffic (from Google)
- Time on page and bounce rate
- Email signups generated from blog content
- Social shares and backlinks (authority signals)
- Actual conversions to leads or customers

**Email Metrics:**

## Monthly Performance Review Process

**2-Hour Monthly Content Audit:**

### Week 1: Data Collection (30 minutes)

1. Export analytics from all platforms
2. Compile performance data in spreadsheet
3. Identify top 3 and bottom 3 performing pieces
4. Note any external factors (holidays, announcements, etc.)

### Week 2: Analysis and Insights (45 minutes)

1. Compare performance to previous month
   - What improved? What declined?
   - Is growth trending up or down?

2. Identify patterns in high-performing content
   - Topics people respond to most
   - Formats that get most engagement
   - Posting times that perform best

3. Analyze audience engagement trends
   - Comments vs. likes (comments = more engaged)
   - Shares (most valuable engagement signal)
   - Follower sentiment

4. Review business impact
   - Which content actually drove leads?
   - Which content converted to customers?
   - Connection between content and revenue

### Week 3: Strategy Adjustment (30 minutes)

1. Update content pillars based on performance
   - If educational content gets 60% of engagement, increase it
   - If behind-the-scenes underperforms, try different angle

2. Adjust posting frequency and timing
   - If 3 posts/week works better than 5, reduce frequency
   - Post content at times when engagement is highest

3. Modify content formats
   - If videos perform better than carousels, create more videos
   - If threads outperform single posts, use more threads

4. Plan A/B tests
   - Test different headlines, posting times, formats
   - Track results of each variation

### Week 4: Implementation Planning (15 minutes)

1. Create next month's content strategy based on learnings
2. Update templates that produced best results
3. Set specific performance goals for upcoming month
4. Schedule content creation sessions
