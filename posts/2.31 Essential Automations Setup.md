_Quick Note: Once again, these properties could have been built into the template to begin, but learning how to use and set up formulas is tricky. This is a great time to customize and play with the formulas - even if it’s only changing the emojis to your own preferences. While Notion formulas can be finicky, even for those with some basic knowledge, I highly recommend you use ChatGPT or Claude AI to help you customize these formulas or create your own additions. They may require trouble-shooting but it’s often a great place to start._

### Step 1: Configure Status-Based Due Dates

Add another formula property called "Next Deadline":

```
if(prop("Status") == "Idea", dateAdd(now(), 7, "days"),  if(prop("Status") == "In Progress", dateAdd(prop("Due Date"), -3, "days"),    if(prop("Status") == "Ready", prop("Due Date"), "Complete")))
```

In your Content Database, add a formula property called "Publishing Timeline":

```
if(prop("Status") == "Idea", "Planning Phase",  if(prop("Status") == "In Progress", "Production Phase",    if(prop("Status") == "Ready", "Publishing Phase", "Complete")))
```

### Step 2: Create Task Reminders

1. Create a "Today's Focus" view:
    - Filter to show tasks where Due Date is today or in the past
    - Filter to exclude Completed tasks
    - Sort by Priority (high to low)

In your Task Database, add a formula property called "Reminder Status":

```
if(prop("Status") == "Completed", "✅ Done",  if(dateBetween(prop("Due Date"), now(), "days") < 0, "🚨 Overdue",    if(dateBetween(prop("Due Date"), now(), "days") <= 2, "⚠️ Due Soon",       "🟢 On Track")))
```

### Step 3: Implement Recurring Task Systems

1. Create a new database called "Recurring Tasks"
2. Add these properties:
    - Task Name (default)
    - Frequency (Select: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)
    - Day of Week (Multi-select: Monday through Sunday)
    - Template Task (Text with detailed description)
3. Create a button that generates tasks:
    - Type /button and name it "Generate This Week's Tasks"
    - This will be a placeholder for future automation capabilities

### Step 4: Create Progress Tracking Automations

In your Project Database, add a formula property called "Completion Rate":

```
round(toNumber(prop("Completed Tasks")) / toNumber(prop("Total Tasks")) * 100) + "%"
```

Add a formula property called "Progress Bar":

```
slice("■■■■■■■■■■", 0, round(toNumber(prop("Completed Tasks")) / toNumber(prop("Total Tasks")) * 10)) + slice("□□□□□□□□□□", 0, 10 - round(toNumber(prop("Completed Tasks")) / toNumber(prop("Total Tasks")) * 10))
```
