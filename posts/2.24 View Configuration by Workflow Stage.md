_Quick note: While I was templated to create the template will all of this functionality built in, I think doing the steps is the best way to learn notion and be able to understand/add customization to your template. If you have any trouble with these lessons, please let me know in the Module Discussions._

    - Select "Calendar" as the view type
    - Configure to show content by publication date
    - Color-code by platform or content type
2. Create a "Content Brainstorming" view:
    - Select "List" as the view type
    - Filter to show only items with "Idea" status
    - Sort by Priority

### Step 2: Create Production-Focused Views

1. Create a "Production Pipeline" view:
    - Select "Board" as the view type
    - Group by Status
    - Filter to show only items in active production (exclude "Idea" and "Published")
    - Sort cards by Due Date
2. Create a "This Week's Production" view:
    - Select "List" as the view type
