## Contract Template Database

### Master Contract Components

Your contract system uses modular components so you can mix-and-match for different project types. Instead of writing contracts from scratch, you combine pre-written sections.

**COMPONENT 1:** Service Agreement Header  
**COMPONENT 2:** Scope of Work (by service type)  
**COMPONENT 3:** Timeline and Milestones  
**COMPONENT 4:** Payment Terms and Schedule  
**COMPONENT 5:** Revision Policy  
**COMPONENT 6:** Communication Protocol  
**COMPONENT 7:** Intellectual Property Rights  
**COMPONENT 8:** Cancellation and Refund Policy  
**COMPONENT 9:** Legal Terms and Liability  
**COMPONENT 10:** Signature and Approval Process

## Building Your Contract System

### Step 1: Create Master Components

Create a document (Google Doc or Notion) with all 10 components. Use clear headings and make it easy to copy-paste sections.

### Step 2: Customize for Your Business

- Update legal terms to reflect your actual business practices
- Consider having a lawyer review at least once
- Customize amounts, timelines, and policies

### Step 3: Set Up Modular System

For each service type you offer, create a "default contract" that combines:
- Your standard scope for that service
- Your typical payment terms
- Your standard revision policy

### Step 4: Automation

- Use DocuSign or HelloSign to automate signing
- Set up templates in your document system
- Create a process for when to use which contract

### Step 5: Regular Updates

Review quarterly. Update:
- Payment terms if rates change
- Policies that need adjustment
- Legal language based on new concerns
