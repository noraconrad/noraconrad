# I'm Nora 👋

Hi, I'm Nora, you can read [about me](/about) here. I'm currently in the process of revamping my website, you can read about that here: [building my knowledge garden](/building-my-knowledge-garden).

While this site used to be my primary income source, I've since "retired" and I am no longer offering 1-on-1 services nor selling courses. All my content is available for free with the exception of some collaborative notion templates that I still sell. If you'd like to support my work in other ways, you can do so here: [support my work](/support).
