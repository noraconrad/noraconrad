In the constant journey to optimize my work, I’ve collected several tools that have significantly improved my productivity that I think deserve some of the hype. Here’s a collection of my current favorites that might just transform your workflow too.

## Minee Timer 4

[_$79 but is on sale for $59 at the time of writing_](https://mineetimer.com/products/minee-4)

This is a simple, but beautifully designed, Pomodoro timer. It’s clean design, simple app and customizable session lengths make it a aesthetic additional to my desk as well as a simple way to have a physical timer while I work. Whether I need the classic 25 minutes or two hours to work uninterrupted, this timer adapts to my needs, and the notifications keep me aware of my time without being disruptive.

## ByDesign

[$4-$6 per month](https://app.bydesign.io/) (use code NORACONRAD for 10% off)

Unlike other task managers, it integrates tasks, habits, and notes in one intuitive interface that feels like using a functional digital planner rather than complex software.

What stands out is its visual project tracking system, perfect for implementing methodologies like the 12-week year. The built-in notes functionality is surprisingly robust - something even premium apps like Akiflow and Sunsama don’t offer well. It strikes the perfect balance between Apple’s basic productivity apps and overwhelming tools like Notion or Asana.

## VoicePal

[_$9.99 for the pro version_](https://app.voicepal.me/referral?via=nora)

Co-founded by Ali Abdaal, this is one of my favorite voice transcribe apps I use. It’s especially helpful for writing content, brainstorming ideas, or even creating notes without having to type everything out manually. I can speak my ideas, and a transcript is generate in seconds, along with prompts and additional questions to help me flesh out my ideas.

You can train it with your own content to help generate outlines, script ideas or even rough drafts. It’s a really simple UI and my go-to when I need to brain dump some content ideas.

## Raycast

[_Ranges from free to $15/mo+ with AI tools_](https://raycast.com/?via=stephanie)

Raycast has become my go-to launcher tool. Think of it like Spotlight on Mac but 10x more powerful. With Raycast, I can access apps, files, web searches, time conversions, AI chat and more, all with a few keystrokes. It’s a huge time saver, and its integration with other apps (like Notion, Toggl, GitHub, Arc, & Obsidian) makes it a customizable tool for both personal and work purposes.

## Save to Notion

[Grab the free chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm?hl=en-US)

Save to Notion is a browser extension that allows me to save anything — articles, images, or snippets — directly into my Notion workspace with just one click. It’s a huge timesaver when I’m researching content or trying to collect resources for future projects without interrupting my workflow.

## Timestripe

[_Ranges from free to $19/mo_](https://timestripe.com/)

Timestripe has changed my long-term planning strategy. This visual planner combines calendar functionality with goal-setting in a way that helps me see the bigger picture. What makes it unique is how it organizes tasks on different timescales , from decades down to days, encouraging better prioritization and focus on what truly matters. The visual timeline display helps me balance tasks with long-term objectives, something I always struggled with in traditional task managers.

## Eightify

[Grab the app for less than $5/mo](https://eightify.app/)

This clever extension automatically generates concise summaries and key points from YouTube videos, saving me time when note taking. Instead of sitting through a 30-minute video, I can quickly scan the main ideas and decide if it’s worth my full attention. For someone who uses YouTube for research and learning, this tool has been insanely valuable for filtering the noise and getting actionable insights.

## Sukha

[Grab a seat for $10](https://www.thesukha.co/app)

This mindfulness app combines gentle reminders with focus timers and screen time insights to create healthier digital habits. Unlike other wellness apps that demand attention, Sukha works quietly in the background, offering just enough guidance to keep me present and productive. My friend, Beth, wrote a full review of it [here](https://medium.com/@pkmbeth/the-single-greatest-app-ive-found-for-my-productivity-ea59739b6888).

## Timery

[Track for free or get all the features for $1/mo](https://timeryapp.com/)

Timery has made time tracking actually enjoyable. As a Toggl user, this app’s clean interface and customizable widgets give me quick access to start and stop timers right from my home screen. What sets it apart is how it visualizes my time data, making patterns immediately apparent. The ability to create time entry templates for common tasks has reduced the friction of logging time, which means I now have more accurate data about where my hours actually go each week.

## Streak CRM

[Try Streak with their free plan](https://get.streak.com/StephanieConrad)

This lightweight CRM lets me track communications, set reminders, and monitor deal progress without switching between multiple platforms. The magic feature for me is the email tracking that shows when messages are opened — invaluable for timing follow-ups. For freelancers and small businesses who live in their inbox, Streak offers just the right amount of organization without overwhelming complexity.
