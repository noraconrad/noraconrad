I recently watched [this video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdj14_jdumI) by [Mel Thomas](https://pagemelt.zone), where they analyzed the book *Filterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture* by Kyle Chayka. It'd a great essay and worth watching. Below are my thoughts mixed with a summary of their arguments.

The first thing we need to understand is that algorithmic feeds are not neutral, they are optimized for engagement, not meaning. They are created for metrics, not people. They promote connection with strangers you'll never know rather than communities that sustain you.

While an algorithm isn't evil, it does have cause for concern when it is the only method in which we consume media and connect with others.

## Artificial Serendipity

The tech industry's response to criticism is predictable: design a "better" algorithm. Call it serendipitous discovery. Call it AI curation. Call it personalized recommendations.

The tech industry has noticed that people yearn for genuine discovery, the kind that happens when you wander a city and stumble upon a small restaurant, when a friend introduces you to a book, when you follow your curiosity down rabbit holes. So they're designing systems that replicate the _feeling_ of serendipity while actually dictating your choices.

Your phone pings with a "serendipitous" restaurant recommendation. But behind that ping: the restaurant pays Google to appear, Google uses data they bought from Meta to target you specifically, and they charge venues increasingly high prices for this "discovery." You feel like you found something yourself. You're actually being herded.

The core issue is that people cannot control their own digital experiences, these experiences are controlled for them. A shift to "serendipitous" design wouldn't fix this problem. Instead, it would strengthen the ways digital technology already controls our lives.

You can't design genuine discovery. You can only create conditions where it might happen. And the moment you try to commodify those conditions, you've destroyed them.

## Desire Paths, Communities, and Bottom-Up Creation

If algorithmic "discovery" is a dead end, what's the alternative?

Millar-MacHugh points to desire paths: the informal footpaths that emerge when people collectively walk the same route, bypassing the planned pathways architects designed. Desire paths form organically, through actual human behavior. They reveal what people actually want, not what someone thought they should want.

Remarkably, the internet is full of people documenting desire paths on, yes, social media. The platforms that make genuine desire paths impossible are simultaneously hosting communities that yearn for them. This contradiction is felt by us all. It points to a real, widespread hunger for digital spaces that emerge from use, not prescription. Spaces that describe how people actually interact, rather than prescribing how they should.

How do communities create these paths? Look to the history Millar-MacHugh cites: queer communities transforming message boards, Tumblr, and Discord servers into lifelines by adapting them in ways the platforms never intended. These weren't officially curated spaces—they were spaces seized and shaped by communities with genuine needs.

This model works because it's driven by necessity and authenticity, not profit. Queer digital communities stand as powerful examples of "bottom-up technology," actively shaping and transforming digital spaces to meet their unique needs through organic evolution and collective innovation. The motivation wasn't to get verified, monetize, or build personal brands. It was to survive, support each other, and organize.

There's a crucial lesson here: authentic curation isn't something designers create. It emerges when communities with real shared interests gather and collectively decide what matters. The platform is secondary. The community and its purpose are primary.

## Building Your Own Digital Garden

This brings us to practical action. If algorithmic feeds are designed to extract and flatten, and artificial serendipity is a trap, what can an individual actually do?

### 1. **Understand You're Already a Curator**

You don't need permission or algorithms to curate. Every time you follow someone, save an article, or share something with a friend, you're curating. The question is: are you curating according to your values and genuine interests, or are you curating according to what the platform rewards?

Mel's point in her video is crucial here: most creators are not making anywhere close to a living off platform content. They're creating for free, for community, for joy. It's tech companies who are taking advantage of that foundational human impulse, not the other way around. If you recognize this, you stop optimizing for algorithms and start asking: what do _I_ actually find interesting? What do I want to share with people I actually know?

### 2. **Build Your Own Information Architecture**

A digital garden isn't a social media profile. It's a personal information ecosystem you control. This might be:

- A personal website or blog (Obsidian Publish, Neocities, even a free WordPress blog are all options here)
- A plaintext file of bookmarks organized by interest
- An RSS reader pulling from blogs and sites you actually trust
- A group chat or email newsletter with people who share your interests
- A physical notebook of discoveries

The technology matters less than the principle: you own your curation layer. You decide what appears in your feed. There's friction, though, you have to actively choose what to read. That friction is a feature, not a bug. It means you're not being passively scrolled at.

### 3. **Reclaim Discovery Through Relationships**

Stop thinking of discovery as something algorithms do to you. Think of it as something communities do together.

How do you actually find good creators and art?

- **Through people you know**: A friend recommends a book. A colleague shares a newsletter. Your sister sends you a TikTok that made her laugh. Word-of-mouth is slower than algorithmic distribution, but it comes with context and actual human judgment.
    
- **Through topical communities**: Find Discord servers, subreddits, Slack groups, or forums devoted to things you care about. Read what people in those communities are talking about and making.
    
- **By following the thread**: Find a creator you like. Look at who they reference, link to, collaborate with. Follow that web. This is what Mel advocates for, following the thread of your own interests rather than letting an algorithm choose the next page for you.
    
- **Through blogs and RSS**: Blogs are slower than algorithmic feeds but they're written by humans with actual POV. Subscribe to RSS feeds from creators, publications, and sites you trust. Use a reader like Feedly or Readwise to manage them. You're back to pulling information rather than having it pushed at you.
    
- **Through archives and rabbit holes**: Before algorithmic feeds, people discovered things by reading deeply. Pick a topic you're curious about and actually research it: read essays, long articles, books. This requires more time and active attention, which is exactly why platforms want you to avoid it. But this is where actual learning and connection is found.
    
- **Through print and local culture**: Zines, small press publications, local galleries, coffee shop bulletin boards. These spaces are harder to optimize, which makes them more resistant to algorithmic flattening. They often host the most interesting work because people create them for love, not for metrics.
    

### 4. **Participate in Genuine Communities**

The digital garden isn't a solo project. It's a garden you tend while being part of communities that tend theirs.

This might mean:

- Contributing to forums or Discord servers around your interests
- Sharing what you find with friends who would actually care
- Creating things (writing, art, music, code) without optimizing for reach
- Engaging with smaller creators directly (comments, emails, messages) rather than hoping the algorithm surfaces your engagement

The queer internet model shows how this works: communities form around shared need and identity, members create tools and spaces to serve each other, things emerge organically. It's not scalable. It's not profitable. It's alive.

### 5. **Accept "Cringe"**

This is Mel's most important contribution. To admit that you've been moved by art is deeply vulnerable. For every piece of art there is someone who thinks it's cringe. But you have to do it anyway.

A digital garden full of things you actually like will contain "cringe" things. Things you've grown out of. Things other people would mock. That's not a sign your taste is bad. It's proof that your taste is yours, not manufactured by an algorithm optimizing for the broadest possible appeal.

Cringe-policing enforces homogeneity. To resist algorithmic flattening, you need to honor your own interests, including the ones you've grown out of, because those interests led you to where you are now.

## Why This Matters (And Why It's Hard)

The tech industry doesn't want you to build a digital garden. Gardens don't scale. They can't be monetized. They can't be surveilled effectively. They're resistant to profit-first logic because they're oriented toward use value, not exchange value.

Creating a genuine digital garden requires friction that platforms actively try to eliminate:

- The friction of choosing what to read rather than endlessly scrolling
- The friction of writing something that might not go viral
- The friction of building community slowly with people you actually know
- The friction of not knowing the metrics on your work

This is why Millar-MacHugh's point about desire paths is so important. Most prescriptive ideas about what the future of technology should look like would simply strengthen the ways digital technology already controls our lives. The solution isn't a better app or a new platform. It's creating space where communities can shape their own digital experiences.

## Practical Starting Points

If you want to start building a digital garden today:

1. **Choose one platform you control**: A blog, a personal website, a shared document, a notebook. Something where your curation isn't subject to algorithmic manipulation.
    
2. **Set up RSS or another pull-based system**: Follow creators, publications, and sites through RSS, email newsletters, or another mechanism where you're actively choosing what to see. Curate intentionally.
    
3. **Identify one community**: A Discord, forum, subreddit, or email list where people with genuine shared interests gather. Participate authentically.
    
4. **Map your influences**: Who are the creators, writers, artists, and thinkers that genuinely matter to you? Follow their work directly. See who they reference. Build outward from there.
    
5. **Create something small**: Write a post, share a link, make a list, start a zine. Something that comes from genuine interest, not optimization.
    
6. **Share it with people who would care**: Not strangers hoping for engagement, but people you actually know or communities you actually participate in.
    

The digital garden won't reach as many people. It won't make you viral. It won't give you metrics to optimize. But it will give you something platforms can't: a digital space that genuinely belongs to you and the communities you choose.

And in a world where attention is the final frontier of extraction, that's radical.
