#### How Sunsama Transformed My Productivity

_This post is sponsored by Sunsama, but I’ve been a fan for many years now_ 😉

![](1*Gt6scCzsD9gMg2gjolkltw.png)

It always starts the same way… a long to-do list, tasks scattered across different apps, emails piling up. I tell myself, ‘Today will be different,’ but by noon, I’m overwhelmed, overworked, and completely off track.

Before Sunsama, my day was scattered with distractions, endless notifications, and trying to catch up on everything at once. My productivity felt like a game of whack-a-mole except I have really really bad aim and I also didn’t have a hammer.

I needed a way to plan my day intentionally instead of just reacting and relying on grit.

That’s when I discovered **Sunsama**.

#### Daily Planning & Time Blocking

Sunsama isn’t just another to-do list; it’s a daily planning assistant. Each morning, Sunsama guides me through a structured planning session where I can set clear priorities and time-block tasks realistically.

By using time blocking, I can set specific time windows for each task, clearly showing me if I have space for focused work. It eliminates guesswork and helps me visualize exactly how my day can unfold.

#### Time Estimates & Overload Prevention

One of Sunsama’s most powerful tools is task time estimation. By estimating how long each task will take, I avoid the all-to-easy trap of underestimating my workload. Sunsama tallies these estimates, alerting me when I’ve scheduled more work than I can realistically complete.

This overload alert prompts me to reprioritize tasks — shifting non-essential items to another day — helping me avoid burnout and stress from overcommitment while setting realistic boundaries of my work-from-home-mom life.

#### Pomodoro Technique Built-In

Sunsama also has a built in timer with the Pomodoro Technique, breaking my work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break, but this is customizable). It’s especially helpful when I need to tackle intensive projects or repetitive tasks without losing momentum. This also works well as a work from home mom so I can plan work effectively around naps, activities and meetings.

Using Pomodoro sessions keeps me energized and productive, dramatically improving my attention and work quality throughout the day.

#### Consolidating Tasks from Multiple Platforms

Before Sunsama, I constantly juggled tasks across emails, Basecamp, Asana, Todoist, Apple Reminders, and even sticky notes. Now, everything pulls directly into Sunsama.

Emails, project tasks, and calendar events sync into one unified space, allowing me to consolidate and prioritize without constantly jumping between apps. This single-source approach saves me valuable mental energy, streamlining my workflow and boosting efficiency. Plus, I don’t need to worry about missing anything important. The two-way sync for their integrations keeps everything up to date without double entries or logging into multiple profiles.

#### Automating Your Workflow with Zapier

While Sunsama offers really fantastic native integrations with popular apps like Notion, Asana, Gmail, Trello, ClickUp, Jira and Slack, there are still gaps — enter Zapier. Zapier allows me to integrate tasks and events from virtually any app that I might use.

For example, when a client adds tasks in Google Tasks (don’t judge me, she just really loves the google ecosystem), Zapier automatically syncs them into Sunsama. Similarly, my financial tracking milestones from Google Sheets automatically become actionable tasks with a zap. Even template sales from Gumroad and Lemon Squeezy instantly trigger follow-up tasks in Sunsama. With this method, literally nothing slips through the cracks.

Zapier bridges critical integration gaps, reducing that last little bit of manual work and frees more of my mental bandwidth. If you’ve never used Zapier before, it’s well worth checking out.

#### Staying Focused and Preventing Burnout

Working from home with kids means distractions are inevitable. Sunsama’s Focus Mode clears digital clutter and minimizes distractions by displaying only today’s tasks — no notifications, no extra tabs, just clear priorities.

Many Sunsama users with ADHD swear by this feature, and I completely understand why. Having one clean, distraction-free view has profoundly improved my ability to engage in deep work sessions. It’s a system I’ve been able to keep up with regardless of my motivation or mood.

Burnout was once a regular part of my life until Sunsama introduced me to its Shutdown Ritual. Each day, Sunsama prompts me to wrap up and intentionally log off, helping me maintain clear boundaries between work and personal life.

Instead of pushing through late evenings, I now honor a defined stopping point, leading to better family time, and a healthier overall mindset around work.
