For a very long time, I just used my mac as it came. I didn’t bother setting up focus modes, customizing settings, or adding apps beyond what I needed for work, but as I’ve been working on my own personal project more, I found myself wanting keyboard shortcuts and actions to be faster.

These are the five apps I’ve added to my mac mini and laptop because I cannot work without them anymore.

### 01 Alfred 🎩

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a pretty well-known app so I’m late to the party. I actually installed this two years ago when I first got my mac but until I actually took the time to learn how to use it, I didn’t realize how powerful it could be. After some youtube tutorials and forcing myself to use Alfred for a few weeks, I’ve become completely dependent on this tool.

Before you get further on this list, almost everything below can be done through Alfred if you upgrade and pay for the power packs. You can find a ton of workflows on [this website](https://www.alfredworkflows.store/) that can replace a ton of other apps.

### 02 Shottr 📷

I take a lot of screenshots for work, so having a tool that made it quick and easy to do this was a huge time saver for my workflow. [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) lets you screenshot entire pages, small clips, and everything in between. It also has a beautiful screenshot editor that lets you find HEX colors, adds text and shapes, crop, and even measure your shot.

I have yet to find a screenshot tool that works as simply and beautifully as this one.

### 03 CopyClip 📋

[CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12) is so simple but it has saved me so much time. You can access your copy/paste history and quickly access it with keyboard shortcuts. As someone who copies and pastes 100x daily, this one app has become a muscle memory for me to use.

### 04 Rocket 🚀

[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) is another simple app that has saved me a lot of time. I already used emojis and the keyboard shortcut regularly, but Rocket makes it even easier and for a small price, I can now quickly access ASCII emoticons, symbols, & glyphs, customize my emoji shortcut names, add snippets, and even gifs.

This might seem like a small addition for something that can be somewhat replicated in the Mac keyboard shortcuts, but this app makes it so much easier that it’s worth the download.

### 05 OnePassword 🔒

If you’re not using a password manager by now, you need to get on this TODAY. After being a long-time LastPass user, I switched to [OnePassword](https://1password.com/) because of the ease of use with iOS, and I’m loving it. I set up vaults for my personal stuff, family stuff, extended family, and work. It’s super quick and easy to set up and it’s saved me hours of time setting up accounts, filling in forms, and remembering logins.

What mac app do you swear by?
