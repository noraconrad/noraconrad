Becoming a Proverbs 31 Woman does not mean you have to be married or have kids. There are verses that mention how to be a good mother and wife, but it is not the point of Proverbs 31, and in some cases, preparing your heart for those things can help bring you closer to God. Working on becoming a Proverbs 31 woman is something that should be practiced daily, no matter where you are in your walk with God or in life.

### PROVERBS 31: A BREAKDOWN

The following passage is Proverbs 31:10–31 in the New Living Translation. I used NLT because I think it simplifies the text and puts it in a language that we use in everyday life. If you want to see this verse in a different translation you can visit [this page](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/pro.31.niv). [This](https://www.bible.com/) website is amazing, you should check it out regardless.

> _A Wife of Noble Character_

> _10 Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?_

> _She is more precious than rubies._

> _11 Her husband can trust her,_

> _and she will greatly enrich his life._

> _12 She brings him good, not harm,_

> _all the days of her life._

> _13S he finds wool and flax_

> _and busily spins it._

> _14 She is like a merchant’s ship,_

> _bringing her food from afar._

> _15 She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household_

> _and plan the day’s work for her servant girls._

> _16 She goes to inspect a field and buys it;_

> _with her earnings she plants a vineyard._

> _17 She is energetic and strong,_

> _a hard worker._

> _18 She makes sure her dealings are profitable;_

> _her lamp burns late into the night._

> _19 Her hands are busy spinning thread,_

> _her fingers twisting fiber._

> _20 She extends a helping hand to the poor_

> _and opens her arms to the needy._

> _21 She has no fear of winter for her household,_

> _for everyone has warm clothes._

> _22 She makes her own bedspreads._

> _She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns._

> _23 Her husband is well known at the city gates,_

> _where he sits with the other civic leaders._

> _24 She makes belted linen garments_

> _and sashes to sell to the merchants._

> _25 She is clothed with strength and dignity,_

> _and she laughs without fear of the future._

> _26 When she speaks, her words are wise,_

> _and she gives instructions with kindness._

> _27 She carefully watches everything in her household_

> _and suffers nothing from laziness._

> _28 Her children stand and bless her._

> _Her husband praises her:_

> _29“There are many virtuous and capable women in the world,_

> _but you surpass them all!”_

> _30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;_

> _but a woman who fears the lord will be greatly praised._

> _31 Reward her for all she has done._

> _Let her deeds publicly declare her praise._

These 21 verses are examples of how we should behave as women of God. I’ll break it down into something a little easier to understand.

### WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?

When I did my Bible study on Proverbs 31 I made a list of each verse and what it meant, below is what I noted for each verse:

#### 10- VIRTUE

The first line begins by telling women they are precious and worthwhile. God calls us to be virtuous and capable. Recognize your own worth and see the value you have as a child of God. Remember that others were also created in the image of God and we have intrinsic value.

#### 11- FAITHFULNESS

We are called to speak the truth and earn the trust of others. We are to be faithful and enrich not only our lives but the people around us as well.

#### 12- GOODNESS

We are called to be good to our husbands and family. To cherish them and love them.

#### 13- HARD-WORKING

God calls us to be hard workers, never lazy, and always improve ourselves.

#### 14- PROVIDER

This verse talks about providing the family with food, cooking, and serving. This can be taken literally or as I see it, to care for and help your family.

#### 15- EARLY RISER

God calls us to wake up before dawn (Maybe one of the hardest tasks for me) and prepare for the day. I see this as God calling us to be hard-working and purposeful with our time. I start my day in prayer and then prepare for the day.

#### 16- BUSINESS SAVVY

This verse was one I had a hard time with. Many people read the Bible and think women should stay home and be housewives. While there is nothing wrong with that, the Lord also calls on us to work hard, earn an income and help our family. It is our job to pay attention to our world and take advantage of opportunities.

#### 17- STRENGTH

Energetic and Strong. This can be your physical strength (working out, health), mental strength (being there for others when they need help), and spiritual strength (asking God for guidance and praying). We are called to do these things with optimism and energy.

#### 18- ENDURANCE

Again, we are called to be hard workers. Not only that, but God asks us to ensure our dealings are well handled, even if it means staying up late. We are called to endure during hard times and to continue to work hard.

#### 19- WELL-ROUNDED

This verse was another hard one for me. I decided that because verse 13 talks about wool and flax, this comparison calls for us to be well-rounded and understanding of many skills. God calls us to learn and grow and by learning different skills we can help our family.

#### 20- CHARITABLE

We are called to help the poor and less fortunate. We are told to love our neighbors and this verse calls us to love those in need by welcoming them with open arms. I also think that has to do with not judging others.

#### 21- PROVIDE AND TRUST

This verse has two key ideas. One is it is our job to provide for our kids and family, to keep them safe and loved. The second is trust in God and his plan. Even during hard times, trust in our work and his is key.

#### 22- WELL DRESSED

This verse is interesting. God asks us to not be consumed by our looks, but here he tells us to be well dressed. The idea is to treat ourselves like we are worth it, which we are! We are told to dress well to present the success that we have made for ourselves and to love ourselves.

#### 23- WIFE TO A GOOD HUSBAND

This verse is God telling us to marry a man who is a good husband and a good leader. There are many places that talk about marriage in the Bible. I think this verse reiterates that God calls us to marry a man with the same faith as ourselves. Someone who loves God will be a good husband and leader.

#### 24- WORKING

Another verse calls us to work for an income. God wants us to provide for ourselves and our families. He asks us to sell our work and earn a living wage.

#### 25- HONORABLE

This is one of my favorite verses. We are called to fear nothing but God. We are told to be honorable and strong and to carry ourselves as graceful women. We are also told to laugh — be happy and optimistic.

#### 26- WISE

We are asked to think before we speak and to always do so with kindness. It is asked that we be wise with what we say.

#### 27- ACTIVE

Laziness is not an option. God calls us to take care of our homes (and families) and to work hard for them.

#### 28- PRAISEWORTHY

We are promised thanks and praise for our hard work. We are asked to take these praises and give back to our families.

#### 29- EXCELS

With God in our hearts, we can do achieve anything we set our sights on. We are told we will succeed and excel.

#### 30- GOD-FEARING

We are called to fear the Lord. He is the only one we should fear, and through that fear, we will come to know him and accept him into our hearts. We are told to live in a way that honors God.

#### 31- REWARDED

The last verse tells us that we will be praised for our hard work and dedication. God promises to recognize our faith.

### HOW TO APPLY PROVERBS 31 TO YOUR LIFE

Obviously, that is a lot to take in. We are not perfect, nor does God expect us to be. Becoming a Proverbs 31 woman means working hard to become a woman who honors God. To simplify this even more I have a list of things I try to do daily/weekly/monthly that helps me become closer to God.

- Remember that you are worthy of God’s grace and love.
- Be truthful and faithful.
- Love others, be good to others and pray for others.
- Work hard in everything you do.
- Wake up early and start the day with God. Pray every day, throughout the day.
- Study and learn. Enrich your life with knowledge and understanding and become well-rounded in your skills.
- Take advantage of opportunities in business, help others, and care for others.
- Be strong and endure hard times. Put your faith in God to help you when you feel lost.
- Love and honor yourself; dress well, exercise, behave well.
- Find friends, partners, spouses, and community who shares your values and love of God.
- Fear God and honor him in all things.
- Remember that you are praise-worthy and will be rewarded for your work, even if that reward is just knowing you have served well.

Proverbs 31 has been one of my favorite studies so far. I took it to heart and I work every day at meeting God’s expectations of all women. I hope this helped you understand what we are called to do and how to achieve it. Even when we fail, God’s grace is there to help us get back on track. Pray over everything and work hard.
