#### _Purposeful Productivity in a world of “get more done”_

We often hear about the importance of productivity — getting more done in less time, staying on top of everything, and pushing through our endless to-do lists. But what if we shift the focus? Instead of asking how we can be more productive, let’s ask why we’re doing these tasks in the first place.

I’ve posted a LOT about productivity — the best apps, the best methods, and the products that will help you focus. But I haven’t been very clear in my message, and for that, I have to apologize. I want to help you let go of “get more done” and focus on having **less** to do. So, let’s make this message clear right now.

### Every task should have a clear purpose that aligns with our needs and values.

It’s not just about doing things efficiently; it’s about making sure the things we do actually matter. For example, do you want to get through your emails quickly so you can close your laptop for the weekend and fully enjoy your time off? Or maybe you want to finish your chores early so you can have a movie night with your kids?

When we identify the purpose behind each task, productivity becomes less about the hustle and more about creating space for what truly matters.

#### Aligning Tasks with Your Values

Think about why you do the things you do. Do you need clean clothes to wear? Then doing laundry makes sense. But if folding your pajamas doesn’t add value to your life — maybe they just end up wrinkled in a drawer anyway — then why spend time on it? Instead, use that time for something that brings you joy or relaxation.

This approach isn’t about shirking responsibilities; it’s about being intentional with your time. If a task doesn’t serve a meaningful purpose, consider whether it’s worth doing at all.

Some of these might be big things: Are you spending way too much time cleaning your home? Maybe you need to get rid of stuff, downsize, or hire cleaners.

Some of these might be controversial: I almost completely stopped watching TV. I’ll watch a movie with my kids or finish off a series I started prior. But I spend about 2 hours each week watching the TV because I don’t enjoy it very much.

Some might seem crazy that you ever did them in the first place: I stopped buying seasonal decor. We have plenty and ultimately it’s just more to store and dust.

These small shifts in how we approach tasks can lead to big changes in our lives. By letting go of unnecessary things, we free up time for what we truly want to do. Whether it’s spending more time with loved ones, diving into a hobby, or simply relaxing without the nagging feeling of an undone chore, purposeful productivity helps focus on what really matters.

#### Practical Tips for Purposeful Productivity

1. **Ask ‘_Why_?’ Before You Start**: Before you begin into a task, ask yourself why it’s important. If the answer aligns with your needs or values, go for it. If not, reconsider whether it needs to be done at all.
2. **Cut Out the Unnecessary**: Identify tasks that don’t add value to your life. Whether it’s folding kids' clothes (yup, we throw them all in drawers around here) or obsessing over a perfectly organized pantry, let go of what doesn’t serve you.
3. **Prioritize What Brings You Joy**: Use the time you save on unnecessary tasks to do something you love. Whether it’s a movie night with the kids or reading a good book, make sure your productivity serves your happiness.
4. **Reflect and Adjust**: Regularly check in with yourself to see if your tasks are aligned with your values. Make adjustments as needed to keep your productivity purposeful and your life balanced. Keeping a log of what you’ve let go of can be a great way to reflect in a month or two and see how much you were doing and how little it matters.

### The Bottom Line

Productivity isn’t about getting more done — it’s about getting the right things done. So next time you find yourself facing an overflowing to-do list, or you are tempted to try the latest organization hack… ask yourself: What’s the _purpose_ behind this?
