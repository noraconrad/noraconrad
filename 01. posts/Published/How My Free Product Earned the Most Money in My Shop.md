#### Lessons in “selling” free products

When I launched my Bible Study Notion Template, I released it as a free download. I had taken my inspiration from another creator and expanded on the idea, so it didn’t feel right to charge for it. I made a quick YouTube video in 2021 about it and shared the notion link in the description.

In early 2024, I decided to list it on my Gumroad shop, just to be able to track how many people were downloading it. I had also listed it on my Notion page so I needed to have an official download link to track those clicks. I put it up on Gumorad, selecting the “Allow customers to pay what they want” setting.

Today, the video has around 21,000 views, and I’ve earned just over $200 from it — a free product.

That might not sound like a lot, but Notion templates are not a top earner for me. I make the majority of my income on contracts, so to earn $200 passively on a FREE product is a bit crazy to me.

My other free templates have good sales but not nearly as many profits. And my Bible Study Template accounts for 64% of my sales. While I think Christians can be very generous, I don’t think that is the reason for this result.

#### The Power of Niche Targeting

By focusing on a specific niche, like Bible Studies, I tapped into a highly engaged audience that found real value in the template. Niche products can resonate deeply with the right audience, leading to success, even with free offerings.

#### The Long-Term Value of Consistent Content Creation

My YouTube video from 2021 continues to drive traffic and sales years later, real proof of the lasting impact of consistent content creation. Quality content can create a sustainable source of passive income over time, even when paired with free products.

#### Filling a Market Gap Can Lead to Success

By creating a Bible Study Notion Template, I filled a gap in the market that wasn’t being adequately addressed at the time. This product resonated with an audience looking for a specific solution, leading to high engagement and sales. Identifying and addressing unmet needs within your niche can set your products apart and create opportunities for success, even with free offerings.

Success doesn’t always come from the most obvious sources. By leaning into niche targeting, creating consistent content, and filling a market gap, I was able to turn a free product into a profitable offering. Moving forward, I plan to continue experimenting with the “pay what you want” model for other niche templates and focus on identifying gaps in the market where I can offer unique solutions.

If you’re thinking about launching your own products, consider how you can apply these lessons. Focus on a niche you’re passionate about, create content that has long-term value, and look for unmet needs that you can address with your offerings. Sometimes, the simplest ideas can lead to the most surprising results.
