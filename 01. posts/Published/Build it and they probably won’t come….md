There was a time when you could build a website, throw up a couple of ads, and work on improving the SEO for a month, and then you’d have a fully operational, passive income generating, self-sustaining website that was earning you $100-$2000 per month. (Who remembers Pat Flynn, the king of this). It was the “build it and they will come” strategy. That time is no more. The internet has evolved, and so have online businesses. In order to build a successful business online in 2023, you need to utilize marketing and know your market.

Marketing is the key to success in any business, and online businesses are no different. In fact, I would argue that online businesses require even more marketing than traditional businesses. With millions of websites out there, it’s not enough to just have a website and hope people find it. You need to actively market your website to your target audience. This means using a combination of tactics including SEO, social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, and more.

Knowing your market is equally important. You need to understand who your target audience is, what their pain points are, what they’re looking for, and how they consume content. This information will help you tailor your marketing efforts to better reach and engage with your target audience. Without this knowledge, you risk wasting time and money on marketing tactics that don’t resonate with your audience.

Every niche and company is different, but I started my ecommerce plant shop just two months ago and these are the things I’ve found to be the key in getting sales. In addition to marketing and market research, there are a few other things you should keep in mind when building a successful online business in 2023:

1. **Focus on providing value:** Your website should provide value to your target audience and not just IF they purchase something. Providing free value is just as important. This could be in the form of informative blog posts, helpful videos, or free resources. By providing value, you’ll build trust with your audience and position yourself as an authority in your niche. You’re showing people what you offer and giving them a reason to want more for you.
2. **Build a community:** People love to feel like they’re part of a group. By building a community around your brand, you’ll create a sense of belonging for your audience. This can be done through social media groups, forums, or even a private membership site. This doesn’t have to be complex, simply commenting on posts, following people back and starting conversations with others in your niche is often the first step.
3. **Stay up-to-date with trends:** The online landscape is constantly changing, and it’s important to stay on top of the latest trends and technologies. This will help you stay ahead of the competition and ensure your website is always relevant and engaging. Read relevant content to your niche, pay attention to trends on social media, watch the news and be aware of what’s happening that could impact your business or your target audience.

If you’re considering starting your own business, or already have one, consider stepping back and taking the time to develop a marketing strategy. There are a ton of free templates online or more complex ones you can purchase on Etsy. Make sure your strategy includes at least the following:

1. **Define your target audience:** Before you can effectively market your business, you need to know who you’re marketing to. Create customer personas that describe your ideal customers and what motivates them.
2. **Choose your marketing channels:** Once you know your target audience, you can choose the marketing channels that will be most effective in reaching them. This could include social media, search engine optimization (SEO), paid advertising, email marketing, or content marketing.
3. **Set your goals:** Your marketing goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). For example, your goal could be to increase website traffic by 50% over the next six months.
4. **Develop your messaging:** Your messaging should be clear, concise, and tailored to your target audience. It should highlight the benefits of your products or services and address your audience’s pain points.
5. **Create a content calendar:** Consistent content is essential for building brand awareness and driving traffic to your website. Create a content calendar that outlines the topics and types of content you’ll create and when they’ll be published.

If you’re not comfortable creating a marketing strategy yourself, or if you don’t have the time, you can hire a marketing agency or consultant to help you. When hiring out, it’s important to do your research and choose a company or individual with a track record of success. Look for someone who specializes in your industry or niche and has experience working with businesses like yours.

When working with a marketing agency or consultant, communication is key. Be clear about your goals, budget, and timeline. Set regular check-ins to review progress and make adjustments as needed. With the right team in place, you can build an effective marketing strategy that helps you achieve your business goals.

As someone who is in the trenches right now, trying to build up my business and get sales, I hope these tips help you. Share what has worked well for you or some advice you’d give to a new business owner in the comments.
