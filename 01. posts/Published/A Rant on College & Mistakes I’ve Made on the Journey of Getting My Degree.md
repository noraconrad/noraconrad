Like most millennials, I graduated from high school with the dream of college — I was set to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder for the fall 2012 semester. I was excited, I had no idea what I wanted to study, and I had absolutely no clue how much it would cost me or how much I would regret this decision.

# Why college has not been for me and reasons I may never return

Long story short — I did poorly in my classes. I didn’t really know how to study and I tanked a couple of my classes early on. I had to keep a 3.0 GPA for the business degree plan I selected, and after a 2.9 first semester, I was put on probation. I was supposed to meet with my advisor every month but for some reason, I fell through the cracks and never got a meeting. After another tough semester, I failed to get my overall GPA above the 3.0 I needed.

No problem, dumb little me thought, I’ll just take a summer class to bump up my GPA and get tutoring if I need to. Unfortunately, I did not have any idea how much my parents and I were paying for school ($12,000 in just that first year) or how we would not qualify for tuition assistance to take “just one easy class” to fix my mistake. I ended up having to drop out and move back home.

When I got home, I started working two jobs and enrolled at MSU Denver, where I spent the next two years commuting an hour each way for a warehouse job, delivering sub sandwiches at night and attending 4 classes at a time during the week with another 20 minute commute and 20 minute light rail trip each way. During that time I moved into my own apartment, racked up another $16,000 in student loans, got engaged and found out that my paternal grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.

My spring 2015 semester was tough, my GPA, which had previously sat at 3.4, dropped to 2.9. Then shortly after enrolling in the summer 2015 semester, I decided to withdraw and focus on work and family for a bit. My grandfather was quickly losing his battle with the cancer that would eventually take his life later that Autumn, I was trying to plan my wedding for the following summer, and I was barely scraping by at my minimum wage jobs.

What I didn’t realize when I decided to take a break from school, is that I had missed my drop date by 2 hours, and after not attending classes for 3 weeks (out of the 8 week program), I got the notification that it was too late to withdraw. I tried to catch back up, but with only 4 weeks left, I ended up failing all three courses. And then my GPA dropped to 1.89. I was put on Academic probation and I never went back.

**_TL;DR: I failed out of school after completing 96 credit hours and dropped out._**

Fast forward to 2022, SEVEN years after dropping out. I get an email from MSU Denver. They are offering a $1000 reoccurring scholarship for returning students to finish their degree. They claim you can easily apply and they even have a $500 scholarship for an online business management degree. I am now a mom of two, working from home and I have some free time. I decide to apply and finally finish the 30 or so credits I need to get my bachelor degree.

I talk to an admission advisor, they say I’m eligible for both scholarships and the Colorado Opportunity Fund — taking two classes this semester will run me around $1200. That’s still expensive, but with a payment plan, my husband and I decide we can make it work. I find out I have to meet with a academic advisor, because that academic probation from 2015 is still on my record and I have to schedule a meeting to get it removed. It takes two weeks to get an appointment, which they only offer in-person. So I drive the 90 minute round trip only to be told my advisor is out sick but she will call me and we can do it over the phone. After another week and a 5 minute phone call where the woman clearly didn’t bother to look at my profile, she tells me I was enrolled for the Summer 2022 semester, not spring and I’ll need to get that updated before she can help me.

So, I meet with advisor number three to get my application updated to Spring. “You’re all set” he tells me, “and I see you’re qualified for the $1000 and $500 scholarships, those will be applied to your account shortly” (Spoiler alert, it was not).

I go back to the second advisor to get my probation removed. It’s quick and easy, I can now register for classes. Which classes though? Oh, I have to meet with a fourth advisor with the online program to figure that out. She can’t help me change my major though, so she forwards me to a fifth advisor who gets my major updated and finally realizes my entire profile is under my maiden name, not my married name. She sends me a form I have to fill out to get this fixed.

Now four weeks after being accepted to the college, I sign up for my two classes. But wait — Not one of those five advisors bothered to notice my 1.89 GPA prevents me from any scholarships, I don’t actually qualify for COF, and I cannot apply for financial aid unless I fill out a Satisfactory Academic Progress form explaining why I had a GPA below a 2.0. Or I can pay almost $3000 for two classes, and by the way, that bill is due next week if I want to attend the Spring semester.

College is made for students fresh out of high school who either have parents who can pay for their classes, or have a low enough income that they can be talked into signing on for massive amounts of debt to get ̶a̶n̶ ̶e̶d̶u̶c̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ a certificate saying they did their time (as if high school meant nothing). For anyone that doesn’t fit into those two categories, you are “other”. You have to jump through hoops just to get signed up and God-forbid you make a mistake, you will have to pay out of pocket to get that cleared up. Yes, you can transfer to another college and get a fresh start on your transcript, but they might not transfer all your credits, and you’ll need to take Anthropology I or Weather & Climate first before you can learn any skills that will actually be valuable for your future career.

The first two years of most bachelor programs are more of what you learned in high school. Basic math, writing and history courses, but this time they cost $900 each. You need 4 credits of a foreign language, that isn’t enough to have you fluent, but you’ll be able to use the right grammar when saying “I’m hungry”.

If you’re lucky, the last two years will have some value in them. For most, you’ll get some basic lessons and then you’ll need to learn on the job skills or boost your resume with 5+ years of experience before you’re able to get a decent salary.

It continuously astonishes how many careers are dependent on one little check mark next to the “has a degree” box. It’s not only devastating to low income families who take the brunt of this cultural norm, but also keeps people from wanting to further their education due to the price and time commitments. We have all these programs and plans to help the people who need it most, but if you failed to take advantage of those programs at the exact right time, you get no support or help at all.

On top of this, we’re paying universities and colleges thousands of dollars a month to have some 19 year old advisor not even bother to pull up your academic profile after waiting weeks for an appointment with them. It’s frustrating and unfair and I can’t do a thing about it.

As I decide what the next decade of my career and life is going to look like, I now have two paths I can take.

1. Go back to school, pay the price, get my GPA up and do this all for as cheap as I can while working extra hours. I can hope it’ll all be worth it in the end and that it may result in a slightly easier shift of career than without the degree.
2. Stop stressing about my choices from a decade ago, and find a path that will let me move forward and doesn’t require a college degree. Pray that if I ever need a career change, I’ll find someone who values experience over a certificate.

As you can imagine, road number two sounds more appealing, but some part of me is still tempted to finish my degree, almost out of spite.
