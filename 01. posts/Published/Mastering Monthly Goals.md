#### A Simple Guide to Resetting Your Month in Notion

Do you ever feel like your goals get stuck at the new year resolution phase, never quite materializing into actionable tasks? Or you struggle to stay on top of your monthly tasks, never sure what should be done next. If so, you’re not alone. Many of us find it challenging to translate our big-picture goals into manageable steps we can tackle daily. Let’s talk about resetting your monthly goals and planning your days with intention, using a simple and free method that will help you take control of your month.

### Setting Intentions for the Month

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of daily task planning, it’s essential to set clear intentions for the month ahead. Intentions are like the guiding stars that steer your actions and decisions throughout the month. They give your goals purpose and direction, making it easier to stay focused and motivated.

Start by reflecting on the previous month. What worked well? What didn’t? Take note of your accomplishments and areas for improvement. This reflection is crucial as it helps you learn from past experiences and fine-tune your systems and routines for the coming month.

Next, think about what you want to achieve in the upcoming month. These can be personal, career, home, financial or any other category of goals. Then, break them down into specific, actions. For example, if your goal is to increase your savings, break it down into smaller tasks like setting a budget, cutting unnecessary subscriptions, or researching additional income streams.

### The Monthly Reset Routine

A monthly reset routine can be a powerful tool for organizing your goals and tasks. The monthly reset involves three steps: reviewing the past month, setting new goals, and converting them into tasks.

1. **Review the Past Month**: Start by reviewing your achievements and areas for improvement from the previous month. Celebrate your wins and learn from any setbacks. This reflection prepares you for setting realistic and meaningful goals in the month ahead.
2. **Set New Goals**: Based on your reflections and intentions, set clear and measurable goals for the upcoming month. Divide your goals into categories, I recommend no more than 4 categories. This categorization helps you maintain a balanced focus across different areas of your life.
3. **Convert Goals into Actionable Tasks**: This is where the intention happens. Take each goal and break it down into actionable tasks with specific due dates.

### Converting Goals into Actionable Tasks

The key to hitting your goals is breaking them down into manageable steps. These are the steps I take to convert goals into actions:

1. **Define Specific Goals**: Clearly define what you want to achieve with each goal. For example, if your goal is to improve your fitness, specify the activities you’ll do to achieve that, such as going for a run three times a week or attending yoga classes.
2. **Break Goals into Tasks**: Once you have defined your goals, break them down into smaller ideas. These ideas should be actionable and realistic. Avoid vague statements like “get in shape” and opt for specific tasks like “go for a 30-minute jog every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.” You might find yourself setting 10–20 action tasks for each goal, that’s good! The smaller you break down the tasks, the more progress you’ll track on the goal.
3. **Set Deadlines**: Assign deadlines to each task to create a sense of urgency and accountability. Use a calendar or task management tool to keep track of deadlines and stay organized. The idea is to set deadlines for the month you’re planning, but you may find there are more tasks than month, simply let one goal span multiple months. This helps you form a more realistic plan for completing your goals.
4. **Prioritize Tasks**: Not all tasks are created equal. Prioritize your tasks based on urgency, importance, and impact. Especially when it comes to work or important deadlines. When you can, focus on completing high-impact tasks that align with your goals and values. Some tasks may be cataloged as urgent, important, and impactful — that’s ok!
5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your progress and adjust your tasks if needed. Be flexible and willing to adapt to changes in schedule or unforeseen roadblocks.

By following this method, you’ll transform your goals from aspirations into actions that move you toward success. Remember, consistency is key. Stay focused and take it one day at a time.
