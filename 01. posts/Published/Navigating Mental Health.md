#### A guide to finding the right therapist and psychiatrist

**_Disclaimer_**: I am not an expert. In fact, I’m new to this entire world. In February 2024, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1 and OCD. I am also sharing this from the United States, so for specific cases in different countries you will need to search for local resources.

When I first faced challenges with my mental health, I felt _lost_.

I suspected I might have ADHD, but the process of finding a therapist or psychiatrist seemed overwhelming. I didn’t know where to start or who to trust. Now that I’ve gone through the journey, I want to share a clear, straightforward approach to finding mental health support online.

### Starting the Journey

If you suspect you have a specific mental health condition, your primary care doctor is a great place to begin. If you don’t currently have one, I recommend scheduling a health checkup with a local doctor, ideally covered by your insurance. These visits are often more affordable than mental health evaluations, and your doctor can use your medical history to help guide you toward a potential diagnosis or refer you to a specialist.

When I visited my primary care provider, I expressed my concerns and was referred to both a therapy practice and a psychiatrist. Although the initial options didn’t work out, they gave me an idea of what to expect and who to talk to.

One thing I learned along the way is that many therapists don’t conduct medical evaluations — psychiatrists **can** diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe medications. Still, depending on your state and the licensing of each individual, their services can vary. This might be common knowledge for some, but it was new information for me.

Don’t be afraid to ask what services they can or cannot perform, some key things to ask:

- Can you perform Psychological Evaluations?
- Can you provide a diagnosis for ABC?
- Do you offer telehealth/in-person appointments?
- Are your services covered by XYZ insurance?
- What kinds of therapies do you offer (modalities)?
- Can you prescribe medications after a diagnosis?

### Finding the Right Fit

I found my first therapist through [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us), a free online resource where you can search for therapists and psychiatrists. It’s a great starting point, especially if you’re looking for professionals who offer telehealth sessions, which can be incredibly convenient, especially for busy parents like me.

That said, be cautious when exploring online therapy services. While platforms like BetterHelp may seem appealing, not all are as legitimate as they appear. Some therapists misrepresent their qualifications, so if you’re new to therapy, it’s always best to start with a primary care provider before jumping into an app-based service.

Although my first therapist couldn’t provide a formal evaluation, she did help me work through some key issues I later brought up with a psychiatrist. After a few months of therapy, I met with a psychiatrist who gave me a thorough evaluation and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and OCD. With that diagnosis, my therapy became much more tailored to my needs, and when my therapist eventually left the practice, I knew I needed to find someone who specialized in those areas.

### Building Your Support Team

The process of finding the right therapist can feel like trial and error, and that’s perfectly okay. Therapy is not one-size-fits-all, so you may need to meet with a few different professionals before finding the right match. I continued using [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) to search for therapists who specialized in bipolar disorder and OCD. If you prefer starting with a psychiatrist, you can follow the same process — just make sure they offer the kind of care you need.

In my case, I eventually found a psychiatrist through a program in Colorado, and they conducted a detailed intake evaluation. After the initial tests, I sought a second opinion, and through it all, I built a team of professionals who work together to support my mental health. My psychiatrist and a nurse practitioner prescribe medication and collaborate closely with my therapist to monitor my progress. I share all this medical data with my primary care provider to make sure my whole-health assessments are available to each person on my team.

The key is to build a reliable support team. These should be people who understand your medical history and are committed to your well-being. If someone isn’t the right fit, don’t hesitate to find someone new. Your mental health journey is personal, and it’s essential to have the right people in your corner.

### Navigating Therapy Options

If you’re juggling a busy schedule or prefer the comfort of home, telehealth therapy is a fantastic option. It’s important to distinguish telehealth services from app-based therapy platforms. With telehealth, you’re connecting with licensed professionals who provide therapy sessions online, offering flexibility without compromising quality. This is a common offering from MANY therapy practices and doctors. App-based therapy is much less regulated and can lead to really bad experiences, my advice is to avoid app-based therapies altogether.

For non-urgent situations, remember that you’re in control of your own pace. You can take time to find the right professionals and even switch therapists if necessary. Try not to get lost in endless research — focus on building a support team that feels right for you.

If you ever find yourself in an urgent mental health crisis, there are always hotlines and resources to turn to. Do not delay getting help just because you can’t find a good fit, sometimes your care team might involve urgent hotline support as well. Do what is best for your needs right now.

#### Hotlines and important resources:

**SAMHSA’s National Hotline (USA)**: 1–800–662-HELP (4357)  
**NHS Hotline (UK):** 111**  
CSPS Hotline (Canada)**: 1–833–456–4566  
[**American Psychological Association Hotlines**](https://www.apa.org/topics/crisis-hotlines)

### Reflecting on the Process

One thing that has helped me stay grounded throughout my mental health journey is journaling. Keeping a log of my experiences allows me to document what I like or dislike about certain doctors and what advice I want to remember. It’s an easy way to track progress and look back on how far you’ve come.

Additionally, being open and honest with your therapist and doctors is crucial. They can only help you with the information you give them. While it may be difficult at first, being transparent about your struggles will lead to more effective therapy and better support.

Finding the right therapist or psychiatrist can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to navigate it alone. Whether you lean on family, friends, or even social media communities, having a strong support system makes a significant difference. As you go through your mental health journey, remember that it’s okay to ask for help, take things at your own pace, and make changes as needed. You deserve a team that genuinely cares about your well-being, and with some patience, you will find them.
