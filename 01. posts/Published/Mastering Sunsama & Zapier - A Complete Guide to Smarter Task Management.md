# **Part 01: Sunsama**

We often hear about the importance of productivity—getting more done, staying on top of everything, and pushing through endless to-do lists. But **what if we shift the focus?** Instead of asking how we can be more productive, let’s ask **why** we’re doing these tasks in the first place.

Before Sunsama, my productivity felt like playing whack-a-mole—except I had no hammer and really bad aim. I needed a **way to plan my day intentionally** instead of just reacting and relying on grit. Sunsama changed everything. It’s **more than just a task manager**—it’s a **structured daily planning tool** that helps you set priorities, time block realistically, and integrate with the tools you already use. **And with Zapier, you can automate even more, cutting out manual work and staying effortlessly organized.**

## **The Secret to Making Any Productivity App Work**

The best productivity tool? The one you **actually use consistently**.

I've tested hundreds—if not thousands—of productivity apps, and the biggest takeaway is this: **Your system only works if you trust it.**

- If you don’t trust your to-do app to remind you when you need to grab milk, you won’t use it.

- If your note-taking app makes it hard to find last week's meeting notes, you’ll switch back to pen and paper.

- If your project manager is cluttered and overwhelming, you’ll avoid using it entirely.

Shiny object syndrome makes us feel like we need the **best** app with the **most features**, but what actually matters is finding a tool you **stick with long enough** to see results. Sunsama works because it prioritizes **consistency, clarity, and alignment with your actual needs.**

## **The Importance of Purposeful Productivity**

Productivity isn't just about getting more done—it’s about **getting the right things done**. Every task should have a clear **purpose** that aligns with your **needs and values**.

When you focus on **why** a task is important, it stops feeling like a never-ending list of obligations and starts becoming a way to **create space for what matters most**. Maybe finishing work early means closing your laptop for the weekend, spending more time with family, or finally pursuing a creative project. Productivity should serve your life, not consume it.

Sunsama encourages this mindset by structuring your workday in a way that prioritizes **meaningful work** while filtering out tasks that don’t contribute to your bigger goals.

## **Getting Started with Sunsama**

### **Step 1: Setting Up Your Account**

- **Sign up for Sunsama** (use [this link](https://try.sunsama.com/noraconrad) for a free trial).

- Choose your preferred **task management tool** to sync (or skip for now).

- Connect your **calendar** to pull in events and block time for tasks.

- Set your **daily planning and shutdown rituals** to maintain structured workflows.

### **Step 2: Daily Planning & Task Prioritization**

Sunsama encourages you to **plan your day before starting**:

1. Add tasks manually or pull them from integrated tools (Notion, Gmail, Asana, etc.).

3. Assign an **estimated time** for each task to prevent over-scheduling.

5. Set priorities using **Objectives**—align tasks with bigger goals.

7. Snooze or move tasks to a **backlog** if they aren’t urgent.

### **Step 3: Time Blocking & Scheduling**

- Drag and drop tasks onto your calendar to **visualize your workload**.

- Use the **Focus Mode** to work on one task at a time.

- Adjust your schedule dynamically—move or extend tasks as needed.

## **Key Features That Make Sunsama Powerful**

### **Time Tracking & Billing with Toggl**

Sunsama provides built-in **time tracking**, offering **daily and weekly breakdowns** of where your time is spent. This feature helps you identify productivity patterns, spot inefficiencies, and adjust your workflow for better focus.

For freelancers and consultants, Sunsama integrates with **Toggl**, allowing you to:

- **Track billable hours** for specific projects or clients.

- **Automate time tracking** based on your Sunsama tasks.

- **Generate detailed reports** for invoicing or time audits.

### **The Importance of Breaks & The Pomodoro Technique**

Taking breaks isn’t a sign of laziness; it’s a necessity for sustainable productivity.

- **Improves Focus & Creativity** – Research shows that short, regular breaks enhance work quality. Our brains need rest to function at their best.

- **Prevents Burnout** – The structured approach of Pomodoro ensures you don’t overwork yourself.

- **Encourages Physical Activity** – Stretching, a brisk walk, or yoga poses can help reenergize your body and mind. A walking pad has been a huge help for me to stay active while working.

- **True Disconnection** – Use breaks to **fully step away** from work. Avoid checking emails—engage in something relaxing instead.

### **Daily Highlight AI: Meaningful Reflection on Work**

Sunsama’s **Daily Highlight AI** helps you reflect on your work instead of just checking off tasks and forgetting about them. This feature creates an insightful summary of your day that you can keep for your records or share with your team.

- **Task Recap & Time Breakdown** – Sunsama automatically organizes what you worked on, showing the planned vs. actual time spent.

- **AI-Generated Summaries** – Highlights your most important work and provides context based on notes or previous activity.

- **Personal Reflection & Prompts** – Customize prompts to guide end-of-day reflections, helping you capture what went well, what needs improvement, and how you feel about the day.

- **Easy Sharing** – Save highlights privately or send them to Slack, Teams, or email.

## Managing Inboxes & Multi-Day Tasks

Notifications and ongoing tasks can easily derail productivity, especially when alerts from multiple apps pull your attention in different directions. Constantly shifting focus to check emails, Slack messages, or project updates disrupts deep work and creates mental clutter. Instead of reacting all day, Sunsama helps centralize and structure your workflow so you can process notifications intentionally without losing focus.

#### **Inbox Triage**

1. **Set Up a Recurring Task** – Create a daily "Inbox Triage" task with subtasks for email, Slack, Asana, etc.

3. **Use a Timer** – Start a timer while processing messages to stay focused and track time spent.

5. **Turn Messages Into Tasks** – Convert emails, Slack messages, or other notifications into Sunsama tasks.

#### **Managing Multi-Day Tasks**

1. **Let Tasks Roll Over** – Log time spent. If unfinished, Sunsama automatically rolls it to the next day.

3. **Use Subtasks** – Break large tasks into steps; completed subtasks mark progress.

5. **Plan With Weekly Objectives** – Create an objective and assign tasks to each workday.

7. **Duplicate When Needed** – Copy tasks if they contain key notes or details.

9. **Leverage Integrations** – Import tasks multiple times from connected tools.

By structuring inbox and task management, you reduce distractions, stay focused, and track progress effortlessly.

# **Part 02: Zapier**

Zapier is an automation tool that connects different apps and services, allowing you to create workflows that streamline repetitive tasks. By setting up automated sequences (called "Zaps"), you can eliminate manual work, improve efficiency, and integrate tools that don’t natively communicate with each other.

Zapier operates on a simple trigger-and-action system:

- **Trigger**: An event that starts the workflow (e.g., receiving an email, adding a new task in Asana, getting a new form submission).

- **Action**: The automated task that follows the trigger (e.g., sending a Slack message, updating a Notion database, creating a new Trello card).

### Setting Up a Zap

1. **Choose a Trigger App**: Select the app where the automation begins (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, or Notion).

3. **Define the Trigger Event**: Specify what action will start the Zap (e.g., receiving a new email with a specific keyword).

5. **Choose an Action App**: Select the app where the automation should take place (e.g., Slack, Asana, Airtable).

7. **Define the Action Event**: Specify what happens in response to the trigger (e.g., creating a new task, sending a notification, updating a spreadsheet).

9. **Test & Activate**: Run a test to ensure the Zap works correctly, then enable it to run automatically in the background.

## Free vs. Premium Plans

Zapier offers different pricing tiers, including a free plan with basic automation and premium plans for more complex workflows.
