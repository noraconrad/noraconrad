#### a round-up of the best planning apps on the market

There is a surplus of task managers, calendar apps, and note-taking software. But if you’re already using those and you’ve been looking for a way to combine the three — a planner app might be better suited. Below are ten planning tools that include at least some task management, scheduling, and standout features that make them unique. I’ve tested each of these over the years, along with countless others, and these 10 make for a great digital planner this year.

### 1. Sunsama

Sunsama, which started in 2021, is a powerful task manager and daily planner integrating with various platforms like ToDoist, Asana, and Notion. It focuses on creating a realistic daily schedule by prioritizing tasks based on available time and importance. They update regularly and listen to the community regarding feature and integration requests.

#### Key Features

- Integrations: Two-way sync from ToDoist, Asana, ClickUp, Google and Outlook calendars/emails, Tello, Jira, Notion, Github and Slack
- Email Management: Incorporates email accounts for focused management, especially on task-based emails
- Daily and Weekly Planning Ritual: Encourages a planning routine, allowing users to drag tasks from other platforms into Sunsama for a realistic day’s plan.
- Flexibility and Focus Mode: Offers flexibility in rescheduling tasks and a focus mode with a built-in Pomodoro timer for concentrated work sessions.
- Timeboxing and Categorization: Schedule your tasks to your calendar, estimate time, track time, categorize your tasks and see reports of where you’re spending your days.

**Best Suited For:** Sunsama is perfect for those managing a complex blend of personal and professional tasks across different platforms.

**Biggest Downside:** Sunsama is expensive at $16–20 per month, if you’re not using some of the integrations already, it may seem unnecessary.

### 2. Ellie Planner

Ellie Planner is an excellent alternative to Sunsama. It focuses on simplicity and elegance in design and has a similar UI to Sunsama.

#### Key Features

- Integrations: Apple Calendar, Google Cal, Zapier, and Slack
- The Brain Dump: A great way to get a lot of tasks out of your mind and into a system without worrying about their organization or categories. Lists offer a way to organize these tasks over time.
- Analytics Interface: Find out how you spend your time and see it broken into beautiful charts with their analytics page.
- Migration from other apps: Migrate to Ellie from Sunsama, a CSV download, or ToDoist with their import options.
- Flexible Pricing: a free plan, $10/mo, or a lifetime option makes Ellie an excellent choice for any budget.

**Best Suited For:** Anyone searching for a visually appealing and emotionally intuitive planning experience without the huge price tag will love Ellie.

**Biggest Downside:** Ellie lacks many small features and details, making it a planner app worth investing in. The integrations can get expensive (with Zapier) if you use many other apps and want to feed them all into Ellie.
