1️⃣ You’ll never truly feel like a grown-up. We’re all new here, no one knows what’s going on and it’s all okay. Be kind and be humble.

2️⃣ Parenting is the toughest job you’ll ever love. It challenges you in ways you never imagined but rewards you immeasurably.

3️⃣ Love is a choice you make every day. It’s more than a feeling; it’s an ongoing commitment.

4️⃣ Pray constantly. If you think you’re bad at it, get to practicing.

5️⃣ Quality over quantity in friendships. You don’t have to please everyone and you rarely will. Be a good friend.

6️⃣ Time is the most valuable currency. Spend it wisely on things and people that matter.

7️⃣ Failure is a stepping stone to success. Don’t fear it; learn from it and keep moving forward. Fail often and fail fast.

8️⃣ Self-care is not selfish. Make time for your mental health and stop treating it as a “treat”.

9️⃣ Trust your instincts. They often know the path even when your mind does not.

🔟 Embrace change. It’s the only constant in life, and it leads to growth.

1️⃣1️⃣ Gratitude turns what we have into enough. Practice it daily to find contentment.

1️⃣2️⃣ It’s okay to say no. Setting boundaries is essential for your well-being.

1️⃣3️⃣ Laughter is the best medicine. Don’t take life too seriously; find joy in the small things and laugh daily.

1️⃣4️⃣ Be present. Moments become memories in the blink of an eye; savor them. Take some photos too.

1️⃣5️⃣ Perfection is an illusion. Stop comparing yourself to others. If you’re having a tough time, get offline.

1️⃣6️⃣ Forgiveness frees you. Letting go of grudges lifts a weight off your shoulders.

1️⃣7️⃣ Kindness costs nothing but means everything. Small acts can make a big difference. Give a compliment.

1️⃣8️⃣ Lifelong learning keeps you young. Stay curious and open-minded. Learn to love learning.

1️⃣9️⃣ Actions speak louder than words. Let your deeds reflect your true self but what your language too.

2️⃣0️⃣ The grass is greener where you water it but if you don’t pull the weeds, those grow too. Stop keeping my things and people around that drain you.

2️⃣1️⃣ Health is wealth. Take care of your body; it’s the only place you have to live. Strengthen your hips and knees, those are like gold.

2️⃣2️⃣ Mistakes are proof you’re trying. They’re opportunities for growth, not reasons for shame.

2️⃣3️⃣ It’s not true that you have to love yourself first for others to love you well. It’s ok for others to love you even while you’re struggling. Be kinder to yourself.

2️⃣4️⃣ Listen more than you speak. You learn more and build stronger connections.

2️⃣5️⃣ Dream big and start small. Every big achievement begins with a single step.

2️⃣6️⃣ Cherish your family. If you don’t have one, build one. You need people.

2️⃣7️⃣ Embrace cringy things. You’re not embarrassing for being who you are and liking things. It’s not your concern what others think of you.

2️⃣8️⃣ Don’t wait for the perfect moment. Tell others you love them and tell them often. Love has no limit and it is never a waste to care for someone.

2️⃣9️⃣ Simplify when life gets complicated. Focus on what truly matters.

3️⃣0️⃣ Faith can move mountains. Believing in something bigger than yourself brings perspective and humility.

3️⃣1️⃣ You were made for a purpose. You are loved and valuable and you are unique. Don’t take that for granted.
