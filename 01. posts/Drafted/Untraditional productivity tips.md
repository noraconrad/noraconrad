 #### If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try these

As a work-from-home mom with young kids, I find myself constantly figuring out new “productivity methods” that fit my phase of life. So many of the traditional productivity tips don’t work when you have toddlers interrupting your workday.

#### 01. Stop doing so much.

One of the hardest things about “getting it all done” is that we usually do too much. When I was feeling overwhelmed by my schedule and facing some health issues, the simplest thing to do was to drop a few things. 

I dropped classes for the semester to give myself a break. I dropped a client, even though I loved working with her because it was just too many hours. I stopped one of my volunteer positions. 

Quitting often feels like failing — but they are not the same. I had said _yes_ to these responsibilities in a different season, and now that I was entering a new routine, I had different capacities.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, ask yourself what can be let go of. So often, our stress is self-inflicted by the things that once were fulfilling.

This might be small things — like trying to “keep up” on laundry. Or let go of a reading goal and just enjoy it. Stop trying to make money from a hobby and take a break from it. Let a plant die. Other times, it may be bigger, quitting a job you hate, stopping a volunteer position, or taking a semester off of school. Give yourself some room to breathe.

#### 02. Outsource, delegate, automate

During a hectic season, we spent $400 a month to have a team of three ladies clean our home every other week. You’re spending less time scrubbing, less money on cleaning supplies, and so much less stress on keeping house. 

There are laundry services that cost ~$5 per load, and they will pick up, clean, dry, and fold your clothes for you. If you hate doing laundry, this can be a huge time saver for you.


#### 03. Done is good enough

We don’t fold our laundry — Our shorts, the kid's pants, and our underwear just go into piles in our drawers. All our shirts, sweaters, and dresses get hung up. I’d rather have the laundry done than have it look neat. We do laundry once a week, make a big pile on our bedroom floor, and the whole family (yes, even the two-year-old) helps us sort and put everything away.
  

#### 04. Invest in easy

I always joke that if something is hand-wash only, it’s not for me. It’s sort of a joke, but I do take this seriously with things like my kid’s water bottles or a set of pajamas. I prefer to buy things that don’t require as much maintenance and upkeep. 

My days are busy, and hand-washing all the dishes at the end of the evening is not something I have time to do. I need to be able to throw in big loads of laundry at once without worrying about the one shirt that needs to be washed differently. We have a Roomba because I don’t have the energy to vacuum daily. 

We try to limit how often we purchase new things for our home, but when we do buy, we pay attention to how much cleaning, fixing, or extra time will need to be invested to keep the item in good condition. Even with big purchases, like couches, carpets, and windows — we chose to buy the materials that would last longer (with kids and pets).

There are times when this process is more expensive. We’ve found saving for the slightly more expensive items over time has saved us a lot of stress and money over the life of the item. For example, we bought our couch 5 years ago and with a damp cloth and a vacuum, it looks brand new (even with two dogs, two toddlers, and a ton of snacks). It wasn’t cheap, we saved up for 6 months, but it’s been well worth it.
