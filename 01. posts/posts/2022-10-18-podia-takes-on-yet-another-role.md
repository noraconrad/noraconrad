If you’ve known me for a while, you might know that my business started almost 15 years ago with website design. I offered basic services for setting up a WordPress website and later, Squarespace websites. I’ve had Squarespace as my web host for over 5 years, and now I’m officially saying goodbye.

When I made the decision to move my blog to Medium in early 2022, I knew my time at Squarespace would be coming to an end. I considered self-hosting again, moving to Notion (that was short-lived), and finally landed on the obvious choice: [Podia](https://podia.sjv.io/nora).

Podia has been my host for my courses and products since April 2019 and I absolutely LOVE them. Their team, the community, and the product itself are simply amazing. They have always been great at innovating and adding more (and better) features, but with the recent additions of Webinars, Communities, and Coaching it’s become easier than ever to have them be a one-stop shop for a small business.

While watching a Podia-hosted round table, I saw that Emily, of [The Creative Bodega](https://emilyconnors.podia.com/), has hosted her website on Podia. So, Wednesday morning after seeing the inspiration, I spent 2 short hours migrating my online home from Squarespace to Podia.

Not only does the move save me $300+ a year on yet another subscription-based service, but I was able to almost perfectly mirror my old website on Podia’s platform.

[Podia](https://podia.sjv.io/nora) is definitely not for everyone, but if you’re a content creator looking for a one-stop shop for your services and content to live, it’s worth consideration.
