# I&#39;m not surprised that this is happening.


I'm not surprised that this is happening.


I'm not surprised that this is happening. The market is so saturated with free productivity apps, some that are truly amazing and others that were thrown together. Like it or not, this is a great way for companies to stand out against the noise.Personally, I was paying for Sunsama because not having to search for an alternative was worth the cost 🤷🏼‍♀️
