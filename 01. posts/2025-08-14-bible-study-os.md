What started as a passion project to integrate Bible study with my personal knowledge management system has now grown into a complete **Bible Study Template in Notion**. This template is designed to help you organize your Bible notes, track sermon insights, and keep track of prayer requests—all in one place. Whether you're new to Bible study or looking for a more structured way to deepen your understanding, this template will support your journey.

**What's Inside:**

- **All Books of the Bible**: Quick access to each book, ready for notes and insights.
    
- **Notes Section**: An area for recording your thoughts, reflections, and sermon notes.
    
- **Prayer Tracker**: Keep track of prayer requests and follow up with answered prayers.
    
- **Web Bible**: The complete World English Bible (WEB), integrated for easy reference.
    
- **Resources & Links**: Includes helpful links to Christian creators, Bible study resources, and video content.
    
- **Bible Study Playlist**: Curated videos and resources to help you understand scripture better.
    

**Included Resources:**

- **Walk-Through Video**: A step-by-step guide to get you started with the template and Notion.
    
- **Cheat Sheet**: A quick reference to help you navigate your new Bible Study system.
    
- **Bible Summaries**: Book summaries from [BibleHub.com](http://BibleHub.com), as well as additional references from _The Bible Project_ and _Overview Bible_.
    
- **Direct Bible Translations**: Links to **CSB, ESV, and KJV** for easy access to different translations.
    

**How This Template Came Together**

Inspired by [Vanderlei Vieira's](https://03e34f11d303435688d13ceee7ddd5e4/) work on Notion, this template has evolved over the past two years. I’ve spent well over **100 hours** refining, editing, and adding new features to make it as comprehensive and user-friendly as possible. Thanks to contributions from [BibleHub.com](http://BibleHub.com) by **Jay Smith** and resources from [The Bible Project](https://bibleproject.com/) and [Overview Bible](https://overviewbible.com/), you’ll find everything you need in one organized space.
