# Stop Playing Productivity Whack-a-Mole

 

## Remember when you started your business to have _more_ freedom?

Now you're answering emails at midnight, your "quick admin tasks" eat up the entire mornings, and your family thinks your laptop is permanently attached to your body.

**What if I told you that organized, automated entrepreneurs get an extra 15+ hours back each week?**

Not by working harder. By building systems that actually _work_.

## FAQs

- #### I'm in a busy season right now. Should I wait?
    
    Busy seasons are the perfect time to implement these systems because that's when you'll see the most immediate benefit. The course is specifically structured with busy schedules in mind: 10-minute lessons, quick-win strategies at the beginning, and a gradual implementation approach that won't overwhelm you. Many students report that the first few lessons alone helped them reclaim 3-5 hours in their first week, even during their busiest periods.
    
- #### Do I need to buy specific tools or software?
    
    All templates are built within Notion, and the courses will recommend certain apps, but ultimately, your tech stack is up to you. The methods taught in the guides and lessons can be adapted to any system. [Click here](/library) if you’d like a peek at some of the tools I recommend.
    
- #### Will this work for my type of business?
    
    Whether you're running a service-based business, e-commerce store, coaching practice, or creative studio, the principles of setting up an operational system are deliberately designed to work across all business models. Entrepreneurs from over 27 different industries have successfully implemented the systems I’ve taught, if it doesn’t work for you I’ll refund your money.
