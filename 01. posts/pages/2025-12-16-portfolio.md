    Stephanie helped me from day one. I was so lost when it came to setting up a blog as a business and she worked with me to sort it all out. Then she went a step further and taught me all sorts of systems and procedures to implement. It was like having my very own personal live course walk me through what I needed to do to expand my impact. I will be forever grateful to her!

With over a **decade** of hands-on experience, I've been in a variety of roles ranging from operations manager to data analyst. I thrive in fast-paced and startup environments. I've got a knack for streamlining tasks and decision-making, making life easier for everyone involved. I’ve mastered logistics, inventory control, and all the finicky sides of platforms like Amazon Vendor Central.

But I’m also about balance; I'm a mom, a wife, and a sister to my beautiful family, who inspire me to stay organized and productive every day. I bring that same dedication to the workplace, whether I’m managing calendars or optimizing systems. Passionate about productivity and tech, I'm your go-to for anything operations and data-based.

Feel free to reach out, whether it's for professional networking or just to swap productivity hacks. I’d love to work with you and meet new people 👋🏼
