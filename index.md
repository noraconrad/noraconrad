Hi, I'm Nora, you can read[[about me]] here. I'm currently in the process of revamping my website, you can read about that here: [[building my knowledge garden]].

While this site used to be my primary income source, I've since "retired" and I am no longer offering 1-on-1 services nor selling courses. All my content is available for free with the exception of some collaborative notion templates that I still sell. If you'd like to support my work in other ways, you can do so here: [[support my work]].
