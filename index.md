Hi, I'm currently [[Building My Knowledge Garden]]

I've been creating content since high school (middle school if you count Neopet guild layouts). This is my knowledge garden; a collection of writing, templates, and resources.

## Browse by Type

[[posts]] — essays and guides on productivity, business, life & wellbeing
*where I share what I've learned over the years*

[[templates]] — Notion, Obsidian, and PDF templates I've built
*tools I've created to help you organize your work*

[[curriculums]] — Mastering Chaos and other course
*structured learning*

[[rambles]] — book reviews, personal essays, reflections
*less polished, more personal*

[[projects]] — things I'm building, apps and other sites
*current work and portfolio*
