### Become a “Systems For Life” writer.

#### Submission guidelines, rules, and sign-up explained

**Systems for Life** isn’t just a productivity blog. We’re building a community of real people who design intentional workflows that transform chaos into clarity. We want stories that go beyond surface-level tips — we want the deep, messy, beautiful truth about how you’ve learned to make life work.

### We’re Interested In:

- How you manage complex life challenges through strategic systems
- Unique workflows that solve real-world problems
- Personal stories of trial, error, and optimization
- Practical, tested strategies across:  
    - Work management  
    - Home organization  
    - Mental health maintenance  
    - Family logistics  
    - Technology integration

### What Makes a Great Submission:

- Authentic, personal narrative
- Concrete, actionable steps
- Vulnerability about what didn’t work (before you found what did)
- Clear, engaging writing style
- Practical takeaways readers can implement

### Who Should Write:

- Remote workers
- Operation managers (we‘ve mastered creating a good SOP)
- Parents juggling multiple responsibilities
- Neurodivergent individuals with innovative coping strategies
- Entrepreneurs who’ve cracked the code on personal efficiency
- Anyone who’s designed a system that changed their life

### Unpublished Work Only

Only share original, unpublished drafts. This way, your story makes a fresh, strong debut for both you and us. We want exclusive, never-before-seen content that provides unique value to our readers.

### Live Up to Your Title

Your title sets expectations. If it promises a “complete review” or “everything you need to know,” deliver depth and detail — no shortcuts or clickbait. Your content should:

- Provide comprehensive insights
- Offer actionable, thorough information
- Match the promise of your headline

#### What We Don’t Want:

- Generic productivity advice
- Inspirational fluff without substance
- One-size-fits-all solutions
- Purely theoretical concepts without real-world testing

### Affiliate Links

Posts built mainly on affiliate links aren’t a fit. We allow a couple of affiliate links, but they must be:

- Backed by solid, valuable content
- Clearly disclosed to readers
- Relevant to the article’s core message

### CTA and Self-Promotion

Keep calls-to-action brief and focused:

- Limit self-promotional links to 2–3 lines max
- Don’t clutter your post with multiple links

### No AI-Generated Content

We’re all about genuine, human-written stories:

- Content must be written by a human
- AI-assisted editing is acceptable, but AI-generated content is not
- Posts that are mostly AI-generated will be rejected
- Repeated submissions of AI content will result in removal from our contributor list

**We want real stories from real people solving real-life challenges.**

### Submission Guidelines

- 500+ words
- Keep it PG, this blog should be able to be read by all
- Personal anecdotes welcome and encouraged
- Technical screenshots or workflow diagrams are a bonus
- Each post must include a title, subtitle and at least one image
- Add captions to your images, let us know the source
