# A simple solution for your multi-app problem

How Plexxy connects all your tasks

### A simple solution for your multi-app problem

#### How Plexxy connects all your tasks

I use Asana for my personal projects, I used Monday for my day job, but I prefer ToDoist for most daily items so I can plan out my day. I’ve been a long-time Zapier user and I have a paid plan with them, but I’ve never been very happy with how difficult it is to get a simple two-way sync between my task apps, especially when it came to my work tasks.

Well, two weeks ago, I got an email from [Pleexy](http://www.pleexy.com) asking if I would try out their site — and this might be the best cold email pitch I’ve ever gotten.

**Full disclosure, this is a paid post, but as always, I maintain full freedom to give you the good, bad and everything in-between.**

### What does Pleexy do?

[Pleexy](http://www.pleexy.com) is a task management solution that allows you to integrate and synchronize your tasks across different applications. By connecting apps like Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Trello, and more, Pleexy enables a streamlined workflow and eliminates the need to switch between multiple platforms. It offers a straightforward solution for users who want a two-way sync between their task apps without the complexities of traditional automation tools.

#### Who Is It Good For?

[Pleexy](http://www.pleexy.com) caters to individuals and teams who rely on multiple task management apps for various purposes. If you find yourself juggling between platforms like Asana, Monday, and ToDoist, Pleexy can bring all your tasks together, simplifying your workflow and enhancing productivity. Whether you’re a freelancer, a project manager, or a professional with diverse responsibilities, Pleexy can help you stay organized and focused.

### Key features

1. Wide Range of Connected Apps: [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com) supports integration with popular task management tools including Asana, Basecamp, ClickUp, Evernote, Jira, Monday, OneNote, Outlook, Trello and Zendesk with Notion coming soon. This extensive compatibility ensures you can connect your preferred platforms and consolidate your tasks effortlessly.
2. User-Friendly Connection Setup: Setting up connections between your task apps is made easy with [Pleexy’s](www.pleexy.com) intuitive interface. It provides step-by-step instructions, making the process straightforward and accessible to users with varying technical expertise. It only took me 2 minutes to sync my tasks (seriously, I timed it, 1 minute and 48 seconds to be exact).
3. [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com) offers near real-time synchronization — faster than any other automation app I’ve tested. It took less than 12 seconds for my task to sync from one app to the next. Realistically, I will never need that fast of a sync, so this feature far exceeded my expectations.
4. Task rules can be used to customize and specify which projects convert to various lists. The settings on the synchronization is fantastic and offers more than enough options to fully match your task management style between apps (see below for my connection from Asana to Google Tasks)

With [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com), you can enjoy the benefits of task synchronization without breaking the bank.

### Pleexy vs. Zapier

As I said, I use Zapier for a handful of other automations, and while it’s a great service, it’s not great for two-way sync on task managers. Let’s look at a breakdown of how to mirror something similar to [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com):

To establish a two-way sync between Google Tasks and Asana using Zapier, you would need to create a Zap with specific triggers and actions:

1. Click on “Make a Zap” to start creating a new Zap.
2. Choose “Google Tasks” as the trigger app and select the trigger event that suits your needs. For example, you can choose “New Task” to trigger the sync whenever a new task is created in Google Tasks.
3. Connect your Google Tasks account to Zapier by following the provided instructions.
4. Configure the trigger settings based on your preferences, such as selecting the Google Tasks list you want to sync with Asana.
5. Proceed to set up the action step by choosing “Asana” as the action app.
6. Select the action event that corresponds to your desired outcome. For instance, you can choose “Create Task” in Asana to add new tasks from Google Tasks.
7. Connect your Asana account to Zapier and authorize the necessary permissions.
8. Customize the action settings, such as specifying the project and task details in Asana.

At this point, you have created a basic one-way sync from Google Tasks to Asana. To establish a two-way sync, you would need to create a second Zap in Zapier, reversing the trigger and action apps. This second Zap would trigger whenever a new task is created or updated in Asana and would add or update the corresponding task in Google Tasks.

The worst part about this setup, is unless you implement additional filters and triggers, you can end up creating an infinite loop where tasks are created over and over until you hit your limit.

As for the cost, Zapier offers different pricing plans. Zapier’s pricing starts at $19.99 per month for the Starter plan, which provides access to basic features and a limited number of tasks. This plan would be necessary if you plan to complete/create over 50 tasks a month (the limit you’d hit on the free plan would be 100 zaps, thus 50 tasks). If you’re doing more than 325 tasks a month, you’d have to go up to the next tier at $39.99 per month. You can quickly see why Zapier is not exactly a cheap or simpler solution to [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com).

### Notes and Improvements

When signing up for [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com), it’s important to note your choice of the primary task manager carefully. Although [it is possible to change your primary task app](https://help.pleexy.com/en/articles/8009989-how-to-change-your-pleexy-s-subscription-to-a-new-task-manager) from Google Tasks to ToDoist, it’s recommended to select the appropriate task manager during the initial setup. Furthermore, while Notion integration is currently listed as planned, it is worth keeping an eye on Pleexy’s [roadmap](https://feedback.pleexy.com/) for future updates and enhancements, I’d love to see the expansion of various task apps including connections between their three sign-up options: ToDoist, Microsoft To Do and Google Tasks.

### Final thoughts

[Pleexy](www.pleexy.com) is a fantastic and super simple solution to an all-to-common problem and will be a great option for a ton of users. If you use even two of the apps listed, it will be well worth the price to have your tasks integrate into one system. I believe every automation step like this can make your day run much smoother and is worth the investment. I will definitely be adding [Pleexy](www.pleexy.com) to my recommended app list and highly recommend you try it out if you’re a user of these apps.
