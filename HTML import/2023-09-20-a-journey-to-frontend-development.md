# A journey to frontend development

### A journey to frontend development

I learned HTML and CSS from Neopets. _Seriously_.

In middle school, Neopets was cool and the fact that I could get a glittering background and some css on a [guild hype page](https://www.neopets.com/~Bacterially) made me feel like I was a genius 🤣

my actual account from 18 years ago

That curiosity eventually led to six years of some website design services. I built out Squarespace and Shopify sites for some small businesses and even started some of my own ([Nora Conrad](https://www.noraconrad.com/) & [Sister Sprouts](https://www.sistersprouts.com/en-us)).

My career so far has included a wide variety of skills ranging from e-commerce to logistics to project management and web design and now I think it’s time to put them all to use. I am actively learning how to code and going to make a plunge into the tech industry.

_(yes, that’s the industry that’s hiring people at $300,000 salaries and then laying them off a few months later — what can I say? I like the challenge)_

I am currently taking online courses to finally finish my bachelor of business administration degree, and while I do that I’m working part-time — which means it’s the perfect time to add in boot camps, certifications, and self-taught practice. Like I said before, I already have a pretty good understanding of HTML and CSS as well as some basic Javascript — but I’ve never taken a “formal” course on any of it.

I found Zero to Mastery through some recommendations and decided to take their [Complete Web Developer course](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/a/aff_n92c9300/external?affcode=441520_-zc_x7eg) _(af link)_ since it will take me through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and some Machine Learning. I’m also working through Harvard’s CS50 course set ([Computer Science,](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) [Intro to Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), [Python & Javascript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), and [AI with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/)). In addition to these coding-specific courses, I’m taking as many computer science courses as I can at my college, so that I can round out my understanding as much as possible.

My goal over the next year is to share my progress in these courses, share projects I complete with these skills and eventually share tips and recommendations for the things that help me the most. I hope to graduate in winter 2024 and be ready to jump into a tech career. I basically have one year to learn as much as I can and build out a portfolio that will get me hired.

I’m about to celebrate my 30th birthday and this feels like a great time to find work I really love.

If you are in the tech world or work as a front-end developer, I would love any advice you have to share. I am excited about this adventure and ready for the challenge of learning these new languages and using them to create cool things.
