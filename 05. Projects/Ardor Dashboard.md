## Description

Custom data-driven dashboard for sales, ROS and SPINs data

## Details

Real-time retail analytics dashboard for Ardor, aggregating weekly sales data from multiple retail channels (KeHE, Amazon Vendor Central, Whole Foods, UNFI). Replaces 2+ hours of manual weekly reporting with automated data pulls and visualization.

## Technologies

- Vercel
- Supabase
- React
- Data Automation (Zapier/custom scripts)
- CSV Parsing

## Features

- Automated weekly CSV ingestion from 4+ retail data sources
- Units per SKU and regional breakdown
- Store count and velocity tracking by product
- Sales trend visualization
- Real-time data refresh and historical tracking

## Challenges

Standardizing data formats across disparate retail platforms; automating CSV processing; designing for non-technical stakeholders to extract insights.

## Outcomes

2-hour weekly reporting reduced to automated dashboard; faster decision-making on inventory and promotional strategy; foundation for expanding to other CPG clients.
