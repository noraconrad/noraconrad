## Description

Full financial management for solo creators

## Details

A web application designed to help content creators track income, expenses, and profitability across multiple revenue streams (sponsorships, YouTube, courses, affiliates, products). Built from personal need—managing complex creator finances without a purpose-built tool.

## Technologies

- Vercel
- Supabase
- React
- Google Sheets API

## Features

- Multi-source income tracking (YouTube, sponsorships, digital products, affiliates)
- Expense categorization and budgeting
- Profitability by revenue stream
- Monthly/annual financial dashboards
- Recurring vs. one-time income visualization

## Challenges

Modeling creator income variability; designing for non-accountants; integrating with disparate data sources (YouTube API, Shopify, manual entry).

## Outcomes

Functional tool for personal use and potential client expansion; demonstrates full-stack product thinking (from problem identification through deployment).
