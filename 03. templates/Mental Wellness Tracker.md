A Notion database to track your habits, mood, stress, anxiety, irritability, energy levels, and activities. This tracker is meant to help anyone with Bipolar, ADHD, OCD, or someone who wants a better idea of how their habits impact their moods. I created this as a personal project and have loved it so much, that I decided to create a free templated version.
